      <p>This document provides best practices related to the publication and
        usage of data on the Web designed to help support a self-sustaining
        ecosystem. Data should be discoverable and understandable by humans and
        machines. Where data is used in some way, whether by the originator of
        the data or by an external party, such usage should also be discoverable
        and the efforts of the data publisher recognized. In short, following
        these best practices will facilitate interaction between publishers and
        consumers.</p>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Data on the Web Best Practices have been developed to encourage and
        enable the continued expansion of the Web as a medium for the exchange
        of data. The growth of open data by governments across the world
        [[OKFN-INDEX]], the increasing publication of research data encouraged
        by organizations like the Research Data Alliance [[RDA]], the harvesting
        and analysis of social media, crowd-sourcing of information, the
        provision of important cultural heritage collections such as at the
        Bibliothèque nationale de France [[BNF]] and the sustained growth in the
        Linked Open Data Cloud [[LODC]], provide some examples of this
        phenomenon.</p>
      <p>In broad terms, data publishers aim to share data either openly or
        through a paywall/firewall. Data consumers (who may also be producers
        themselves) want to be able to find and use data, especially if it is
        accurate, regularly updated and guaranteed to be available at all times.
        This creates a fundamental need for a common understanding between data
        publishers and data consumers. Without this agreement, data publishers'
        efforts may be incompatible with data consumers' desires.</p>
      <p>Publishing data on the Web creates new challenges, such as how to
        represent, describe and make data available in a way that it will be
        easy to find and to understand. In this context, it becomes crucial to
        provide guidance to publishers that will improve consistency in the way
        data is managed, thus promoting the reuse of data and also to foster
        trust in the data among developers, whatever technology they choose to
        use, increasing the potential for genuine innovation.</p>
      <p>This document sets out a series of best practices that will help
        publishers and consumers face the new challenges and opportunities posed
        by data on the Web. </p>
      <div class="issue"><p><a href="https://www.w3.org/2013/dwbp/track/issues/100">Tracker Issue 100</a></p>

 <p>I am not sure if it still makes sense to organize BP around the
        phases of the lifecycle. <br>
        I removed the following sentence about organizing BP around the phases:
        "These best practices are organized around the different phases of the
        Data on the Web lifecycle, which provides a framework for considering
        the several tasks that will need to be performed on a dataset throughout
        its life on the Web. As proposed by [MOLLER], data is a living thing
        that moves through various stages, such as creation, publishing, use or
        termination."</p> </div>
      <p>Best practices cover different aspects related to data publishing and
        consumption, like data formats, data access, data identification and
        metadata. In order to delimit the scope and elicit the required features
        for Data on the Web Best Practices, the <abbr title="Data on the Web Best Practices">DWBP</abbr>
        working group compiled a set of use cases [[UCR]] that represent
        scenarios of how data is commonly published on the Web and how it is
        used. The set of requirements derived from these use cases were used to
        guide the development of the best practice.</p>

      <h2>Audience</h2>
      <p>This document provides best practices to those who publish data on the
        Web. The best practices are designed to meet the needs of information
        management staff, developers, and wider groups such as scientists
        interested in sharing and reusing research data on the Web. Every
        attempt has been made to make the document as readable and usable as
        possible while still retaining the accuracy and clarity needed in a
        technical specification. </p>
      <p>Readers of this document are expected to be familiar with some
        fundamental concepts of the architecture of the Web [[!WEBARCH]], such
        as resources and URIs, as well as a number of data formats. The
        normative element of each best practice is the <em>intended outcome</em>.
        Possible implementations are suggested and, where appropriate, these
        recommend the use of a particular technology such as <abbr title="Comma Separataed Variables">CSV</abbr>,
        JSON or RDF. A basic knowledge of vocabularies and data models would be
        helpful to better understand some aspects of this document. </p>
      <p>This document is not targeted solely at data publishers; others
        interested on using the published data are encouraged to read it.</p>
      <p></p>
    </section>
    <section id="scope" class="informative">
      <h2>Scope</h2>
      <p>This document is concerned solely with best practices that:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>are unique to publishing or reusing data on the Web;</li>
        <li>encourage publication or reuse of data on the Web;</li>
        <li>can be tested by machines, humans or a combination of the two.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>As noted above, whether a best practice has or has not been followed
        should be judged against the <em>intended outcome</em>, not the
        specific implementation which is offered as guidance. A best practice is
        always subject to improvement as we learn and evolve the Web together.</p>

        <h2>Data on the Web Challenges</h2>
        <p>The openness and flexibility of the Web creates new challenges for
          data publishers and data consumers. In contrast to conventional
          databases, for example, where there's is a single data model to
          represent the data and a database management system (DBMS) to control
          data access, data on the Web allows for the existence of multiple ways
          to represent and to access data. Furthermore, publishers and consumers
          may be unknown to each other and be part of entirely disparate
          communities with different norms and in-built assumptions so that it
          becomes essential to provide information about data structure,
          quality, provenance and any terms of use. The following list
          summarizes some of the main challenges faced when publishing or
          consuming data on the Web. These challenges were identified from the <abbr

            title="Data on the Web Best Practices">DWBP</abbr> Use Cases and
          Requirements [[UCR]] and are described by one or more questions.</p>

      <section id="lifecycle">
        <h2>Data on the Web Lifecycle</h2>
        <p>Literature presents a lot of proposals for data lifecycles ranging
          from multimedia data [[HARDMAN]] to digital libraries [[LIFECYC]].
          Knud Möller [[MOLLER]] presents a survey of lifecycle models for
          data-centric domains as well as an Abstract Data Lifecycle Model (<abbr

            title="Abstract Data Lifecycle Model">ADLM</abbr>) comprising a set
          of phases, features and roles that can be used to classify and compare
          existing lifecycle models. <abbr title="Abstract Data Lifecycle Model">ADLM</abbr>
          also provides the basis to construct new lifecycle models for
          data-centric domains. Following this pattern, a generic lifecycle
          model for data-centric domains comprises the following main phases: <em>Ontology
            development</em>, <em>Planning</em>, <em>Creation</em>, <em>Archiving</em>,
          <em>Refinement</em>, <em>Publication</em>, <em>Access</em>, <em>External
            use</em>, <em>Feedback</em> and <em>Termination</em>.</p>
        <p>The Data on the Web lifecycle is an instance of an <abbr title="Abstract Data Lifecycle Model">ADLM</abbr>.
          In what follows, the <abbr title="Abstract Data Lifecycle Model">ADLM</abbr>
          phases are revisited and defined according to the data on the Web
          context. It is important to note that the ontology development phase
          is not included, since it is considered an independent phase that can
          take place <i>a priori</i>. The termination phase is also out of
          scope since it is not possible to make sure that a piece of data was
          completely removed from the Web. </p>
        <ul>
          <li><em>Data Planning</em>: this phase concerns the moment when the
            intent to publish data on the Web takes a concrete form. It also
            comprises the selection of data to be published.</li>
          <li><em>Data Creation</em>: defines the moment when new data is
            created, i.e, it means that the data did not previously exist on the
            Web. It may comprise the extraction of data from existing data
            sources and its transformation to a proper format or structure for
            publishing on the Web. </li>
          <li><em>Data Publication</em>: this phase concerns the moment when
            data is made accessible on the Web.</li>
          <li><em>Access</em>: denotes the moment in the lifecycle when users
            gain access to the data available on the Web.</li>
          <li><em>External use</em>: implies that data was used to perform some
            further actions like the creation of visualizations or data
            analysis.</li>
          <li><em>Feedback</em>: this phase concerns the moment when users
            comment on the data or metadata they have previously accessed and
            used.</li>
          <li><em>Refinement</em>: this phase covers all kinds of activities
            that make additions or changes to data that already exist on the
            Web. It also concerns the management of data versioning. </li>
          <li><em>Data Archiving</em>: defines the moment when data no longer
            needs to be available on the Web. </li>
        </ul>

        <img src="images/lifecyclesvg.svg" alt="The diagram shows the different phases of the Data on the Web lifecycle"

          width="450">
        <p>As proposed in [[MOLLER]], the data on the Web lifecycle model is an
          evolving one, since there is no restriction for data to pass through
          all phases of the lifecycle before the start of a new iteration,
          neither a specific point of the lifecyle to begin with.</p>
        <p>In the data on the Web context, two main roles may be played by
          actors in the lifecycle: data publisher and data consumer. The data
          publisher role may be played by several actors who are responsible for
          performing actions like data and metadata creation, and data
          publication and archiving. The data consumer are these actors who
          receive and consume the data. Of course consumers may well also be
          publishers.</p>

      <h2>The Best Practices</h2>
      <p>This section contains a number of best practices to be used by data
        publishers in order to help both data publishers and data consumers to
        overcome the different challenges faced during the 
        data on the Web lifecycle. One or more best practices were
        proposed for each one of the previously described challenges. Each BP is
        related to one or more requirements from <a href="http://w3c.github.io/dwbp/usecasesv1.html#R-UniqueIdentifier">the
          Data on the Web Best Practices Use Cases &amp; Requirements document.</a></p>

        <h3>Best Practices for Metadata</h3>
        <div class="issue"><p><a href="https://www.w3.org/2013/dwbp/track/issues/105">Tracker Issue 105</a></p><p> Should we use "Best Practices for Metadata" or just
          "Metadata"? </p></div>
        <p>Metadata is data about data. It provides additional information about
          data, to help consumers better understand the meaning of data, its
          structure, and to clarify other issues, as for example, license of
          use, the organization that generated the data, data quality, data
          access, the update schedule of datasets, etc.</p>
        <p>Metadata can be used to help tasks as, for example, dataset discovery
          and reuse, and can be assigned considering different granularity that
          goes from a single property of a resource to a whole dataset, or all
          datasets from a specific organization.</p>
        <p>Metadata can be of different types. These types can be classified in
          different taxonomies, with different grouping criterias. For example,
          a specific taxonomy could define three metadata types according to
          descriptive, structural and administrative features. Descriptive
          metadata serves to identify a dataset, structural metadata serves to
          understand the format that the dataset is distributed and
          administrative metadata serves to provide information about version,
          update schedule, etc. A different taxonomy could define metadata types
          with a scheme according to tasks where metadata are used, for example,
          discovery and reuse.</p>
        <p>This document specifies the intended outcomes for each best practice
          and then gives some guidance on possible implementation methods. In
          terms of metadata, the particular implementation method will depend on
          the format of the dataset distribution, for example, metadata
          describing a CSV file should be provided in a different way than for
          an RDF dataset. However, the <em>intention</em> is the same
          irrespective of format.</p>

        <h3>Best Practices for Data Vocabularies</h3>
        <p>Datasets often resort to a range of vocabularies in the data they
          contain: data values are entered or captured in a controlled way,
          i.e., for certain positions in a data graph (or column in a
          relationship table), the value used should come with a limited set of
          pre-existing resources: for example object types, roles of a person,
          countries in a geographic area, or possible subjects for books. Such
          vocabularies aim to represent a set of terms and the relationship
          among them, in order to ensure a level of control, standardization and
          interoperability in the data. They can also provide a way to easily
          create richer data. Say, a dataset contain one reference in a data
          statement to a concept description in several languages. This single
          statement allows applications to localize their display of their
          search depending on the language of the user. The vocabularies can
          also have different forms (e.g. thesaurus, taxonomy, semantic network)
          and be represented in different formats (e.g. RDF, OWL, JSON, CSV).
          This section presents best practices for data vocabularies accessible
          as URI sets on the Web. </p>
        <p> According to <a href="http://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/ontology">
            W3C </a>, Vocabularies define the concepts and relationships (also
          referred to as “terms”) used to describe and represent an area of
          concern. Vocabularies are used to classify the terms that can be used
          in a particular application, characterize possible relationships, and
          define possible constraints on using those terms. In practice,
          vocabularies can be very complex (with several thousands of terms) or
          very simple (describing one or two concepts only). There is no clear
          division between what is referred to as “vocabularies” and
          “ontologies”. The trend is to use the word “ontology” for more
          complex, and possibly quite formal collection of terms, whereas
          “vocabulary” is used when such strict formalism is not necessarily
          used or only in a very loose sense. Vocabularies are the basic
          building blocks for inference techniques on the Semantic Web. W3C
          offers different ways for creating Vocabularies on the Web in a
          standard format, such as: </p>

          <li> <a href="http://www.w3.org/standards/techs/rif#w3c_all"> RIF </a>:
            W3C Rule Interchange Format (RIF) for writing declarative rules and
            production rules on the Web. </li>
        </ol>
        <p> Vocabularies can be of two different types: </p>
        <ol>
          <li> Light-weight: annotation-oriented (used for information search),
            describing the concepts and their relationships. Here is recommended
            the use of SKOS or RDF and RDF Schema.</li>
          <li> Heavy-weight: the body of knowledge that describes a given
            domain, describing the concepts and relationships between them from
            both perspectives: hierarchy and aggregation/composition. In
            addition, such heavy-weight descriptions provide the axiomatization
            of semantics constraints between those concepts and relations. Here
            is recommended the use of OWL and RIF.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>How to create vocabularies?</h4>
        <p> Three different approaches may be adopted to create vocabularies: </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Top-layer: the whole building process compliant with the
            conventional software development process </li>
          <li>Middle-layer: Generic constraints and guidelines which specify
            major steps </li>
          <li>Bottom-layer: The most fine-grain guidelines such as those for
            class identification process, design of URIs, ODP, Anti-Patterns
            etc.</li>
        </ol>
        Some of the Best Practices for the creation of vocabularies are
        presented in the following.

        <h4> How to find vocabularies ? </h4>
        <p> In order to be possible the reuse of vocabularies, it is important
          to provide ways to find them, when they are available on the Web. The
          can be done by using different approaches, such as: </p>
        <ol>
          <li> Search tools: <a href="http://ws.nju.edu.cn/falcons/objectsearch/index.jsp">
              Falcons </a> , <a href="http://watson.kmi.open.ac.uk/WatsonWUI/">Watson</a>,

        </ol>
        <p> Others include the LOV directory, Prefix.cc, Bioportal (biological
          domain) and the European Commission's Joinup platform.</p>
        <h3>How to choose vocabularies?</h3>
        <p> It is very important to know how to choose the vocabulary to be
          reused. For doing this, see <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/ld-bp/#VOCABULARIES">Vocabulary
            Checklist</a> </p>
        <h3> How to reuse vocabularies ? </h3>
        <p> In order to provide semantic interoperability between applications,
          it is important to reuse well-know vocabularies wherever possible.
          This should be done by defining terms to be shared with meaning and
          unambiguously.</p>

          <h3>Best Practices for Data Preservation</h3>
          <p>Data preservation is a well understood and commonly performed tasks
            for static and self-contained data. This commonly includes the
            following steps:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Ingest the data and assign a persistent identifier to it</li>
            <li>Ensure the data is correctly stored and prevent bit rot</li>
            <li>Provide access to the data and perform format translation if
              needed</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The model most commonly referred to is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Archival_Information_System">
              Open Archival Information System</a>. Many institutions taking
            care of digital preservation are implementing this model or some
            variant of it. Web pages can be preserved following the same
            strategies, considering a web site as a static data set that is
            self-contained and can be all snap-shoted and preserved at a fixed
            time. When it comes to Web data some new elements have to be taken
            into account, namely:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The persistent identifiers (IRI) used across the web are related
              to live data that can change</li>
            <li>The meaning of a resource is contextualized by the other
              resources it is linked to</li>
            <li>Documents fetched in HTML, RDF of JSON, for instance, are only
              one of the many possible serialisation of the data they represent</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The preservation of Web data should generaly focus on the
            preservation of the description of entities.</p>
          <div class="practice">
            <p><span id="list_resources" class="practicelab">Maintain a list of
                resources described in a dataset</span></p>

              <ul>
                <li>Web data is about the description of resources identified
                  with a IRI.</li>
                <li>It is to be expected that queries made by data consumers
                  will resolve around finding a preserved description about a
                  particular resource.</li>

              <p class="subhead">What</p>
              <p>Web data is essentially about the description of entities
                identified by a unique, Web-based, identifier (a URI). Once the
                data is dumped and sent to a institute specialised in digital
                preservation the link with the Web is broken (de-referencing)
                but the role of the URI as a unique identifier still remains. In
                order to increase the usability of preserved dataset dumps it is
                relevant to maintain a list of these identifiers.</p>

                separately. For RDF and JSON-LD, this corresponds to all the

                file format obsolescence. Datasets which have been acquierd in
                some format some years ago may have to be converted into another
                format in order to still be usable with more modern software
                (see [[ROSENTHAL]]). This tasks can be made more challenge, or
                even impossible, if non standard serialisation formats are used
                by data depositors.</p>

              <p class="subhead">What</p>
              <p>During its live cycle a Web data dataset may undergo several
                modifications. Although IRIs assigned to things are not expected
                to change, the description of these resource will evolve over
                time. There are also some new IRIs that will be put into use,
                some other that will become deprecated, and some that will get
                deleted. Along to this evolution several snapshots could be made
                available for preservation. An example of this is DBpedia which
                has undergo several releases since its first publication and
                always use the same IRI for its resources. Every resource is
                de-referenced to the most up to date description available for
                it along with a link to preserved descriptions using the
                protocol Memento (see <a href="http://mementoweb.org/depot/native/dbpedia/">Memento
                  gateway for DBpedia</a>)</p>

              <p class="subhead">Intended Outcome</p>
              <p>A link is maintained between the IRI of a things, the most
                up-to-date description available for it and preserved
                descriptions. If the resource does not exist any more the
                description should say so and refer to the last preserved
                description that was available for it.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="how">
              <p class="subhead">Possible Approach to Implementation</p>
              <p>There is a variety of HTTP status code that could be put into
                use to relate the IRI with its preserved description. In
                particular, 200, 404, 410, 303 and 209 can be used for different
                scenarios:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>200 =&gt; there is a new description which contains pointers
                  to archived description</li>
                <li>404 =&gt; the resource just died, the URI consumer has to go
                  find an archive to look for it</li>
                <li>410 =&gt; dead again but this time it's a controlled process</li>
                <li>303 =&gt; the description of this URI is no longer served
                  here but there is a preserved description at a different
                  location</li>
                <li>209 =&gt; this resource does not exist any more but we have
                  some information about it. The description could include a
                  list of locations having different preserved descriptions over
                  different times.</li>
              </ul>
              Next to the status codes, HTTP header can also be used to relate
              resources. </section>
