      <p>This document provides best practices related to the publication and
        usage of data on the Web designed to help support a self-sustaining
        ecosystem. Data should be discoverable and understandable by humans and
        machines. Where data is used in some way, whether by the originator of
        the data or by an external party, such usage should also be discoverable
        and the efforts of the data publisher recognized. In short, following
        these best practices will facilitate interaction between publishers and
        consumers.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="sotd">
      <p>This version of the document shows its expected scope and future
        direction. A template is used to show the "what", "why" and "how" of
        each best practice. Comments are sought on the usefulness of this
        approach and the expected scope of the final document.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="intro" class="informative">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>The best practices described below have been developed to encourage and
        enable the continued expansion of the Web as a medium for the exchange
        of data. The growth of open data by governments across the world
        [[OKFN-INDEX]], the increasing publication of research data encouraged
        by organizations like the Research Data Alliance [[RDA]], the harvesting
        and analysis of social media, crowd-sourcing of information, the
        provision of important cultural heritage collections such as at the
        Biblioth√®que nationale de France [[BNF]] and the sustained growth in the
        Linked Open Data Cloud [[LODC]], provide some examples of this
        phenomenon.</p>
      <p>In broad terms, data publishers aim to share data either openly or with
        controlled access. Data consumers (who may also be producers themselves)
        want to be able to find and use data, especially if it is accurate,
        regularly updated and guaranteed to be available at all times. This
        creates a fundamental need for a common understanding between data
        publishers and data consumers. Without this agreement, data publishers'
        efforts may be incompatible with data consumers' desires.</p>
      <p>Publishing data on the Web creates new challenges, such as how to
        represent, describe and make data available in a way that it will be
        easy to find and to understand. In this context, it becomes crucial to
        provide guidance to publishers that will improve consistency in the way
        data is managed, thus promoting the re-use of data and also to foster
        trust in the data among developers, whatever technology they choose to
        use, increasing the potential for genuine innovation.</p>
      <p>This document sets out a series of best practices that will help
        publishers and consumers face the new challenges and opportunities posed
        by data on the Web. </p>
      <p>Best practices cover different aspects related to data publishing and
        consumption, like data formats, data access, data identifiers and
        metadata. In order to delimit the scope and elicit the required features
        for Data on the Web Best Practices, the <abbr title="Data on the Web Best Practices">DWBP</abbr>
        working group compiled a set of use cases [[UCR]] that represent
        scenarios of how data is commonly published on the Web and how it is
        used. The set of requirements derived from these use cases were used to
        guide the development of the best practices.</p>
      <p>The Best Practices proposed in this document are intended to serve a
        more general purpose than the practices suggested in Best Practices for
        Publishing Linked Data [[LD-BP]] since it is domain-independent and
        whilst it recommends the use of Linked Data, it also promotes best
        practices for data on the web in formats such as [[CSV]] and [[JSON]].
        The Best Practices related to the use of vocabularies incorporate
        practices that stem from Best Practices for Publishing Linked Data where
        appropriate.</p>

      <h2>Audience</h2>
      <p>This document provides best practices to those who publish data on the
        Web. The best practices are designed to meet the needs of information
        management staff, developers, and wider groups such as scientists
        interested in sharing and re-using research data on the Web. While data
        publishers are our primary audience, we encourage all those engaged in
        related activities to become familiar with it. Every attempt has been
        made to make the document as readable and usable as possible while still
        retaining the accuracy and clarity needed in a technical specification.</p>
      <p>Readers of this document are expected to be familiar with some
        fundamental concepts of the architecture of the Web [[WEBARCH]], such as
        resources and URIs, as well as a number of data formats. The normative
        element of each best practice is the <em>intended outcome</em>.
        Possible implementations are suggested and, where appropriate, these
        recommend the use of a particular technology such as <abbr title="Comma Separataed Variables">CSV</abbr>,
        JSON or RDF. A basic knowledge of vocabularies and data models would be
        helpful to better understand some aspects of this document. </p>
    </section>
    <section id="scope" class="informative">
      <h2>Scope</h2>
      <p>This document is concerned solely with best practices that:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>are specifically relevant to data published on the Web;</li>
        <li>encourage publication or re-use of data on the Web;</li>
        <li>can be tested by machines, humans or a combination of the two.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>As noted above, whether a best practice has or has not been followed
        should be judged against the <em>intended outcome</em>, not the <em>possible
          approach to implementation</em> which is offered as guidance. A best
        practice is always subject to improvement as we learn and evolve the Web
        together.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="context" class="informative">
      <h2>Context</h2>
      <p> In general, the Best Practices proposed for publication and usage of
        Data on the Web refer to datasets and distributions. For this document,
        as defined by [[DCAT]], "a dataset is a collection of data, available
        for access or download in one or more formats". By data, "we mean known
        facts that can be recorded and that have implicit meaning" [[Navathe]].
        In ordet to meet the requirements of several data consumers datasets
        should be available in more than one distribution. Again quoting the
        [[DCAT]] specification, a distribution "Represents a specific available
        form of a dataset. Each dataset might be available in different forms,
        these forms might represent different formats of the dataset or
        different endpoints. Examples of distributions include a downloadable
        CSV file, an API or an RSS feed".</p>
      <p> In our context, two importante aspects should be considered when
        publishing data on the Web: the sharing of data in a large scale and the
        use of the Web as a platform for data publication and sharing. Large
        scale data sharing allows datasets to be used for several groups of data
        consumers, which may have distinct requirements and expectations about
        the data. Given this heterogeneity and the fact that data publishers and
        data consumers may be unknown to each other, it is necessary to offer
        some additional information to help understanding and manipulating the
        data. Such information may also contribute to leverage dataset
        trustworthy and reuse. Additional information that should be published
        as part of the dataset includes but is not limited to: structural
        metadata, descriptive metadata, access information, data quality
        information, provenance information, license information and usage
        information. </p>
      <p> The second aspect, the use of the Web as a platform for data
        publication and sharing, concerns the architectural bases of the Web as
        discussed in [[WEBARCH]]. The DWBP document is mainly interested on the
        Identification principle that says that URIs should be used to identify
        resources. In our context, a resource may be a whole dataset or a
        specific item of given dataset. All resources should be published with
        stable URIs, so that they can be referenced. At the very least, give
        them unique and stable URIs, if you don't want to make them directly
        accessible. Besides it should be possible to create links between
        resources. A link may be defined as a relationship between two resources
        when one resource refers to the other resource by means of a URI. </p>
      <p>The following diagram illustrates the dataset composition (data values
        and description) together with other components related to the dataset
        publication and usage. Data values correspond to the data itself and may
        be available in one or more distributions, which should be defined by
        the publisher considering data consumer's expectations. The Description
        component corresponds to the additional information that describes the
        dataset and helps the manipulation and the reuse of the data.&nbsp; In
        order to allow an easy access to the dataset and its corresponding distributions
        multiple Dataset Access mechanisms should be available such as APIs and
        bulk download. Finally, to promote the interoperability among datasets
        it is important to adopt Data Vocabularies and Standards&nbsp;. &nbsp; </p>

      <h2>Data on the Web Challenges</h2>
      <p>The openness and flexibility of the Web creates new challenges for data
        publishers and data consumers. In contrast to conventional databases,
        for example, where there is a single data model to represent the data
        and a database management system (DBMS) to control data access, data on
        the Web allows for the existence of multiple ways to represent and to
        access data. Furthermore, publishers and consumers may be unknown to
        each other and be part of entirely disparate communities with different
        norms and in-built assumptions so that it becomes essential to provide
        information about data structure, quality, provenance and any terms of
        use. The following diagram summarizes some of the main challenges faced
        when publishing or consuming data on the Web. These challenges were
        identified from the <abbr title="Data on the Web Best Practices">DWBP</abbr>
        Use Cases and Requirements [[UCR]] and are described by one or more
        questions. As presented in the diagram, each one of these challenges is
        addressed by one or more best practices.</p>
      <embed type="image/svg+xml" src="challenges.svg" style="width:100%" id="challengesSVG">
      Data on the Web Challenges
      <p> Each one of these challenges originated one or more requirements as
        documented in <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp-ucr/#requirements">the
          use-cases document</a>. The development of Data on the Web Best
        Practices were guided by these requirements, in such a way that each
        best practice should have at least one of these requirements as an
        evidence of its relevance.</p>

      <h2>The Best Practices</h2>
      <p>This section contains the best practices to be used by data publishers
        in order to help them and data consumers to overcome the different
        challenges faced when publishing and consuming data on the Web. One or
        more best practices were proposed for each one of the previously
        described challenges. Each BP is related to one or more requirements
        from the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp-ucr/">Data on the Web Best
          Practices Use Cases &amp; Requirements document.</a></p>
      <section id="basicExample">
        <h3>Example</h3>
        <p> This example serves as a basis for elaboration that will be
          described in subsequent sections. It helps to illustrate how best
          practices may be applied. </p>
        <div class="example">
          <p> John works for the Transport Agency of MyCity and he is in charge
            of the publication of data on the Web about bus timetables as well
            as real time data about the traffic of the city. John decides to
            create two datasets: one for the bus timetables and other one for
            the real time traffic data. </p>
          <p> Some requirements that should be addressed:</p>
          <ul>
            <li> The dataset for bus timetables must be available in two
              languages: english and portuguese; </li>
            <li> Both datasets must be available in csv and json-ld formats; </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        When necessary RDF examples will be used to show the result of the
        application of some best practices. RDF examples in this document are
        written in Turtle syntax [[TURTLE]] and [[JSON-LD]]. </section>
      <div class="note">
        <p> In this current version, examples are presented just in Turtle
          syntax. </p>
      </div>
      <section id="metadata">
        <h3>Metadata</h3>
        <p>The Web is an open information space, where the absence of a specific
          context, such a company's internal information system, means that the
          provision of metadata is a fundamental requirement. Data will not be
          discoverable or reusable by anyone other than the publisher if
          insufficient metadata is provided. Metadata provides additional
          information that helps data consumers better understand the meaning of
          data, its structure, and to clarify other issues, such as rights and
          license terms, the organization that generated the data, data quality,
          data access methods and the update schedule of datasets. <br>
        </p>
        Metadata can be used to help tasks such as dataset discovery and re-use,
        and can be assigned considering different levels of granularity from a
        single property of a resource to a whole dataset, or all datasets from a
        specific organization. <br>
        <p>Metadata can be of different types. These types can be classified in
          different taxonomies, with different grouping criteria. For example, a
          specific taxonomy could define three metadata types according to
          descriptive, structural and administrative features. Descriptive
          metadata serves to identify a dataset, structural metadata serves to
          understand the structure in which the dataset is distributed and
          administrative metadata serves to provide information about the
          version, update schedule etc. A different taxonomy could define
          metadata types with a scheme according to tasks where metadata are
          used, for example, discovery and re-use. </p>

            <p>Providing metadata is a fundamental requirement when publishing
              data on the Web because data publishers and data consumers may be
              unkown to each other. Then, it is essential to provide information
              that helps data consumers, i.e., human users and computer
              applications, to understand the data as well as other important
              aspects that describes a dataset.</p>

            <p class="subhead">Intended Outcome</p>
            <p> It must be possible for humans to understand the metadata, which
              makes it <span style="font-style: italic;">human readable
                metadata</span>.</p>
            <p>It should be possible for computer applications, notably user

          <section class="how">
            <p class="subhead">Possible Approach to Implementation</p>
            Possible approaches to provide <em>human readable metadata:</em><br>
            <ul>
              <li>to provide metadata as part of an HTML Web page</li>
              <li>to provide metadata as a separate text file</li>
            </ul>
            Possible approaches to provide <em>machine readable metadata:</em><br>
            <ul>
              <li> machine readable metadata may be provided in a serialization
                format such as Turtle and JSON, or it can be embedded in the
                HTML page using [[JSON-LD]], or [[HTML-RDFA]] or [[Microdata]].
                If multiple formats are published separately, they should be

      <section id="provenance">
        <h3>Data Provenance</h3>
        <p>Provenance originates from the French term "provenir" (to come from),
          which is used to describe the curation process of artwork as art is
          passed from owner to owner. Data provenance, in a similar way, is
          metadata that allows data providers to pass details about the data
          history to data users. Provenance becomes particularly important when
          data is shared between collaborators who might not have direct contact
          with one another either due to proximity or because the published data
          outlives the lifespan of the data provider projects or organizations.</p>
        <p>The Web brings together business, engineering, and scientific
          communities creating collaborative opportunities that were previously
          unimaginable. The challenge in publishing data on the Web is providing
          an appropriate level of detail about its origin. The data publishers
          may not necessarily be the data provider and so collecting and
          conveying this corresponding metadata is particularly important.
          Without provenance, consumers have no inherent way to trust the
          integrity and credibility of the data being shared. Data publishers in
          turn need to be aware of the needs of prospective consumer communities
          to know how much provenance detail is appropriate. </p>
        <!-- <p>To meet this need, the W3C community offers the Provenance Ontology
            [[PROV-O]] so that data publishers can formally describe data            provenance and methodologies so that consumers can query and use            provenance information. </p> -->

        <h3>Data Quality</h3>
        <p>Data quality is commonly defined as ‚Äúfitness for use‚Äù for a specific
          application or use case. It can affect the potentiality of the
          application that use data, as a consequence, its inclusion in the data
          publishing and consumption pipelines is of primary importance.</p>
        <p>Usually, the assessment of quality involves different kinds of
          quality dimensions, each representing groups of characteristics that
          are relevant to publishers and consumers. Measures and metrics are
          defined to assess the quality for each dimension. There are heuristics
          designed to fit specific assessment situations that rely on quality
          indicators, namely, pieces of data content, pieces of data
          meta-information, and human ratings that give indications about the
          suitability of data for some intended use.</p>
        <!--<p>Dimensions and metrics to adopt might largely depend on the
            specific application scenario, or even on the data domain. A            systematic review of dimensions, metrics adopted in the context of            Linked Open Data can be found in the recent literature (e.g., see            [[ZAVERI]]). </p> -->

        <p> Datasets published on the Web may change over time. Some datasets
          are updated on a schedule basis and other datasets are changed as
          improvements in collecting the data make updates worthwhile. In order
          to deal with these changes, new versions of a dataset may be created.
          In general, a dataset B is considered a version of an existing dataset
          A, when A and B store values for the same observation about the world
          and dataset B gives new values to such observation. These new values
          may result, for example, from the updating of existing data, the
          inclusion of new data or even the adaptation of values to a new
          context. To illustrate this definition, consider the following
          scenarios related to a dataset that collects data about bus
          timetables:</p>
        <ul>
          <li> Scenario 1: a new bus stop is created and its timetable doesn‚Äôt
            exist on the dataset;</li>
          <li> Scenario 2: an existing bus stop is removed and its timetable
            should be deleted from the dataset;</li>
          <li> Scneario 3: an error was identified in one of the existing
            timetables stored in the dataset and this error must be corrected;</li>
          <li> Scenario 4: the timetables available on the dataset need to be
            translted to another language;</li>
        </ul>
        <p> In all scenarios, a new dataset, i.e. a new version of the existing
          dataset, should be created to reflect the corresponding update. Even
          for small changes it is important to keep track of the different
          dataset versions to make the dataset trustworthy. Publishers should
          remember that a given dataset may be in use for one or more data
          consumers and they should be notified about the creation of new
          versions or it should be possible to automatically identify different
          versions of the same dataset. All these types of dataset updates need
          a consistent, informative approach to versioning, so data consumers
          can understand and work with the changing data. </p>
        <p> It is important to note that the creation of multiple datasets to
          represent time series as well as spatial series, e.g. the same kind of
          data for different regions, are not considered as multiple versions
          for the same dataset. In this case, each dataset covers a different
          observation about the world and should be treated as a new dataset
          instead of a new version of an existing dataset. This is the case of a
          dataset that collects data about weakly weather forecast of a given
          city, where every week a new dataset should be created to store data
          about that specific week. </p>
        <!--
        <p>Data on the Web often changes over time. Many datasets are updated on          a scheduled basis, such as census data or funding data that changes          every fiscal year. Other datasets are changed as improvements in          collecting the data make updates worthwhile. Still other data changes
          in real time or near real time. All these types of data need a          consistent, informative approach to versioning, so data consumers can          understand and work with the changing data. </p>        <p>In order to deal with changes over time, multiple versions may be
          created for a single dataset. To illustrate this let us consider a          simple example: a dataset that collects data about weekly weather          forecast for MyCity. The following figure shows the relation between          the dataset (Dataset001) and its different versions (Dataset001_W1,
          Dataset001_W2, Dataset001_W3 and Dataset001_W4), where each version          corresponds to the weather forecast of a week of May 2015. Each          dataset version has two different distributions: one in CSV and one in          JSON. For example, the version Dataset001_W1 has two distributions:
          Dataset001_W1_csv and Dataset001_W1_json. </p>        <figure id="contextDiagram"> <img alt="A single node on the left hand side is the Dataset, lines from here split to link to 4 versions of the dataset, each of which is linked to two distributions of each one, making a total of 8 files for this one dataset."            src="images/DWBP_Context.svg"> <figcaption>Diagram showing the
            relationships between Dataset, Versions and Distributions</figcaption>        </figure> -->

          and managing different versions of datasets.</p>

            <p>Version information makes a dataset uniquely identifiable.
              Uniqueness can be used by data consumers to determine how data has
              changed over time and to determine specifically which version of a
              dataset they are working with. Good data versioning enables
              consumers to understand if a newer version of a dataset is
              available. Explicit versioning allows for repeatability in
              research, enables comparisons, and prevents confusion. Using
              unique version numbers that follow a standardized approach can
              also set consumer expectations about how the versions differ.</p>

            <p> The precise method adopted for providing versioning information

            <ul>
              <li>Include a unique version number as part of the metadata for

              <li>Provide a description of what has changed since the previous
                version. </li>
              <li>If the data is made available through an API, the URI used to
                request the latest version of the data should not change as the
                versions change, but it should be possible to request a specific

        <h3>Data Identifiers</h3>
        <p>Identifiers take many forms and are used extensively in every information system. 
           Data discovery, usage and citation on the Web depends fundamentally
          on the use of HTTP (or HTTPS) URIs: globally unique identifiers that can be looked up by
          dereferencing them over the Internet [[RFC3986]]. It is perhaps worth emphasizing some key points about URIs in the
          current context.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>URIs are 'dumb strings', that is, they carry no semantics. Their
            function is purely to identify a resource.</li>
          <li>Although the previous point is accurate, it would be perverse for
            a URI such as http://example.com/dataset.csv to return anything other
            than a CSV file. Human readability is helpful.</li>
          <li>When de-referenced (looked up), a single URI may offer the same
            resource in more than one format. http://example.com/dataset may
            offer the same data in, say, CSV, JSON and XML. The server returns
            the most appropriate format based on <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/Negotiation">
              content negotiation </a>.</li>
          <li>One URI may redirect to another.</li>
          <li>De-referencing a URI triggers a computer program to run on a
            server so that the URI acts as a call to an API. The server may
            therefore do something as simple as return a single, static file, or
            it may carry out complex processing. Precisely what processing is
            carried out, i.e. the software on the server, is completely
            independent of the URI itself.</li>

<p>Where a data publisher is unable or unwilling to manage its URI space directly for persistence, an alternative approach is to use a redirection service such as <a href="http://purl.org/">purl.org</a>. This provides persistent URIs that can be redirected as required so that the eventual location can be ephemeral. The <a href="http://www.purlz.org/">software behind such services </a> is freely available so that it can be installed and managed locally if required.</p>
            <p>Digital Object Identifiers <a href="http://doi.org/">(DOIs)</a> offer a similar alternative. These identifiers are defined independently of any Web technology but can be appended to a 'URI stub.' DOIs are an important part of the digital infrastructure

            <p>The power of the Web lies in the <em>Network effect</em>. The first telephone only became useful when the second telephone meant there was someone to call; the third telephone made both of them more useful yet. Data becomes more valuable if it refers to other people's data about the same thing, the same place, the same concept, the same event, the same person, and so on. That means using the same identifiers across datasets and making sure that your identifiers can be referred to by other datasets. When those identifiers are HTTP URIs, they can be looked up and more data discovered.</p>

            <p class="subhead">Possible Approach to Implementation</p>
            <p>This is a topic in itself and a general document such as this can only include superficial detail.</p>
            <p>Developers know that very often the problem they're trying to solve will have already been solved by other people. In the same way, if you're looking for a set of identifiers for obvious things like countries, currencies, subjects, species, proteins, cities and regions, Nobel prize winners ‚Äì someone's done it already. The steps described for <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/ld-bp/#how-to-find-existing-vocabularies">discovering existing vocabularies</a> [[LD-BP]] can readily be adapted.</p><ul>
              <li>ensure URI sets you use are published by a trusted group or organization;</li>
              <li>ensure URI sets have permanent URIs.</li></ul>
              <p>If you can't find an existing set of identifiers that meet your needs then you'll need to create your own, following the patterns for URI persistence so that others will add value to your data by linking to it.</p>
              <p>URIs can be long. In a dataset of even moderate size, storing each URI is likely to be repetitive and obviously wasteful. Instead, define locally unique identifiers for each element and provide data that allows them to be converted to globally unique URIs programmatically. The Metadata Vocabulary for Tabular Data [[tabular-metadata]] provides mechanisms for doing this within tabular data such as CSV files, in particular using <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/tabular-metadata/#uri-template-properties">URI template properties</a> such as the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/tabular-metadata/#cell-aboutUrl">about URL</a> property.</p>
              <p>These ideas are at the heart of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/LinkedData.html">5 Stars of Linked Data</a> where one data point links to another, and of <a href="http://dret.github.io/webdata/">Hypermedia</a> where links may be to further data or to services (or more generally 'affordances') that act on or relate to the data in some way. Examples include a bug reporting mechanisms, processors, a visualization engine, a sensor, an actuator etc. In both Linked Data and Hypermedia, the emphasis is put on the ability for machines to traverse from one resource to another following links that express relationships.</p>

        <h3>Data Formats</h3>
        <p>The formats in which data is made available to consumers are a key
          aspect of making that data usable. The best, most flexible access
          mechanism in the world is pointless unless it serves data in formats
          that enable use and reuse. Below we detail best practices in selecting
          formats for your data, both at the level of files and that of
          individual fields. W3C encourages use of formats that can be used by
          the widest possible audience and processed most readily by computing
          systems. Source formats, such as database dumps or spreadsheets, used
          to generate the final published format, are out of scope. This
          document is concerned with what is actually published rather than
          internal systems used to generate the published data.</p>

            <p>As data becomes more ubiquitous, and datasets become larger and

              Posting data in a format that is not machine readable places
              severe limitations on the continuing usefulness of the data. Data
              becomes useful when it has been processed and transformed into
              information. </p>
            <p> Using non-standard data formats is costly and inefficient, and
              the data may lose meaning as it is transformed. On the other hand,
              standardized data formats enable interoperability as well as
              future uses, such as remixing or visualization, many of which
              cannot be anticipated when the data is first published. The use of
              non-proprietary data formats should also be considered since it

        <h3>Data Vocabularies</h3>
        <div class="issue"> There is a discussion going on in the group if the
          creation (and publication) of vocabularies is in the scope of the DWBP
          document.</div>
        <p>Data is often represented in a structured and controlled way, making
          reference to a range of vocabularies, for example, by defining types
          of nodes and links in a data graph or types of values for columns in a
          table, such as the subject of a book, or a relationship ‚Äúknows‚Äù
          between two persons. Additionally, the values used may come from a
          limited set of pre-existing values or resources: for example object
          types, roles of a person, countries in a geographic area, or possible
          subjects for books. Such vocabularies ensure a level of control,
          standardization and interoperability in the data. They can also serve
          to improve the usability of datasets. Say, a dataset contains a
          reference to a concept described in several languages. Such reference
          allows applications to localize their display of their search
          depending on the language of the user. </p>
        <p>According to W3C, <a href="http://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/ontology">vocabularies</a>
          define the concepts and relationships (also referred to as ‚Äúterms‚Äù or ‚Äúattributes‚Äù)
          used to describe and represent an area of concern. Vocabularies are
          used to classify the terms that can be used in a particular
          application, characterize possible relationships, and define possible
          constraints on using those terms. Several categories of vocabularies
          have been coined, for example, ontology, controlled vocabulary,
          thesaurus, taxonomy, code list, semantic network.</p>
        <p>There is no strict division between the artifacts referred to by
          these names. ‚ÄúOntology‚Äù tends however to denote the vocabularies of
          classes and properties that structure the descriptions of resources in
          (linked) datasets. In relational databases, these correspond to the
          names of tables and columns; in XML, they correspond to the elements
          defined by an XML Schema. Ontologies are the key building blocks for
          inference techniques on the Semantic Web. The first means offered by
          W3C for creating ontologies is the RDF Schema [[RDF-SCHEMA]] language.
          It is possible to define more expressive ontologies with additional
          axioms using languages such as those in The Web Ontology Language
          [[OWL2-OVERVIEW]]. </p>
        <p>On the other hand, ‚Äúcontrolled vocabularies‚Äù, ‚Äúconcept schemes‚Äù,
          ‚Äúknowledge organization systems‚Äù enumerate and define resources that
          can be employed in the descriptions made with the former kind of
          vocabulary. A concept from a thesaurus, say, ‚Äúarchitecture‚Äù, will for
          example be used in the subject field for a book description (where
          ‚Äúsubject‚Äù has been defined in an ontology for books). For defining the
          terms in these vocabularies, complex formalisms are most often not
          needed. Simpler models have thus been proposed to represent and
          exchange them, such as the ISO 25964 data model [[ISO-25964]] or W3C's
          Simple Knowledge Organization System [[SKOS-PRIMER]].</p>

            <p>Before defining any new vocabulary, a first preliminary step               is to analyze whether there are any              other public vocabularies that have been previously applied to the              same scope of knowledge we intend to work with. In case we find              any, there are several criteria that we <em class="rfc2119">should</em>              consider to assess the suitability of re-using that vocabulary for              our use case:</p>            <ul>              <li>Frequent use: Although there is an increasingly number of                available vocabularies, just a reduced number of them have been                internationally recognized as standards de jure or de facto.                Common vocabularies greatly facilitate re-use, so we should                prioritize those that have demonstrated previous broad adoption.</li>              <li>Expressiveness: it is important to assess to what extent the                candidate vocabulary may cover all aspects included in our                dataset, as well as whether the expressiveness degree is                sufficient for the disaggregation level of our data.</li>              <li>Activity and maintenance: the vocabulary <em class="rfc2119">should</em>                be actively maintained, and offer a clear policy to collect                feedback and perform updates.</li>              <li>Quality of publication: as per our best practice "Document                vocabularies" above, the vocabularies <em class="rfc2119">should</em>                have sufficient documentation to be able to interpret the                meaning of their elements in a unambiguous way. In addition,                vocabularies that are <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/swbp-vocab-pub/">designed                  and published under the Linked Data paradigm</a> will offer                enhanced reusability.</li>            </ul> -->

              comparison and linking of datasets exploiting them. Highly
              formalized data is also harder to exploit by inference engines:
              for example, using an OWL class in a position where a SKOS concept
              is enough, or using OWL classes with complex OWL axioms raises the
              formal complexity of the data according to the OWL Profiles
              [[OWL2-PROFILES]]. Data producers should therefore seek to
              identify the right level of formalization for particular domains,
              audiences and tasks, and maybe offer different formalization
              levels when one size does not fit all.</p>

              used for representing attributes of the resources described in a
              dataset. When simpler models are enough to convey the necessary
              semantics, represent vocabularies using them. For instance, for
              Linked Data, SKOS may be preferred for simple vocabularies as

        <h3>Sensitive Data</h3>
        <p>Sensitive data is any designated data or metadata that is used in
          limited ways and/or intended for limited audiences. Sensitive data may
          include personal data, corporate or government data, and mishandling
          of published sensitive data may lead to damages to individuals or
          organizations.</p>
        <p>To support best practices for publishing sensitive data, data
          publishers should identify all sensitive data, assess the exposure
          risk, determine the intended usage, data user audience and any related
          usage policies, obtain appropriate approval, and determine the
          appropriate security measures needed to taken to protect the data.
          Appropriate security measures should also account for secure
          authentication and use of HTTPS.</p>
        <p>At times, because of sharing policies sensitive data may not be
          available in part or in its entirety. Data unavailability represents
          gaps that may affect the overall analysis of datasets. To account for
          unavailable data, data publishers should publish information about
          unavoidable data gaps.</p>

        <h3>Data Access</h3>
        <p>Providing easy access to data on the Web enables both humans and
          machines to take advantage of the benefits of sharing data using the
          Web infrastructure. By default, the Web offers access using Hypertext
          Transfer Protocol (HTTP) methods. This provides access to data at an
          atomic transaction level. However, when data is distributed across
          multiple files or requires more sophisticated retrieval methods
          different approaches can be adopted to enable data access, including
          bulk download and <abbr title="Application Programming Interfaces">API</abbr>s.
          </p>
        <p>One approach is packaging data in bulk using non-proprietary file
          formats (for example tar files). Using this approach, bulk data is
          generally pre-processed server side where multiple files or directory
          trees of files are provided as one downloadable file. When bulk data
          is being retrieved from non-file system solutions, depending on the
          data user communities, the data publisher can offer APIs to support a
          series of retrieval operations representing a single transaction.</p>
        <p>For data that is streaming to the Web in ‚Äúreal time‚Äù or ‚Äúnear real
          time‚Äù, data publishers should publish data or use APIs to enable
          immediate access to data, allowing access to critical time sensitive
          data, such as emergency information, weather forecasting data, or
          published system metrics. In general, APIs should be available to
          allow third parties to automatically search and retrieve data
          published on the Web. </p>
        <p>On a further note, it can be observed that data on the Web is
          essentially about the description of entities identified by a unique,
          Web-based, identifier (a URI). Once the data is dumped and sent to an
          institute specialised in digital preservation the link with the Web is
          broken (de-referencing) but the role of the URI as a unique identifier
          still remains. In order to increase the usability of preserved dataset
          dumps it is relevant to maintain a list of these identifiers. </p>

            available for bulk download. </p>
          <section class="axioms">
            <p class="subhead">Why</p>
            <p>When web data is distributed across many URLs and logically
              organized as one container, accessing the data in bulk is useful.
              Bulk access provides a consistent means to handle the data as one
              container. Without it, individually accessing data is cumbersome
              leading to inconsistent approaches to handling the container.</p>

            <p> It should be possible to download data on the Web in bulk. Data
              publishers should provide a way either through bulk file formats

            <p class="subhead">Possible Approach to Implementation</p>
            <p>Depending on the nature of the data and consumer needs possible
              approaches could include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Preprocessing a copy of the data in compressed archive format
                where the data more easily accessible as one URL. This is
                particularly useful for handling data that changes infrequently
                or on a scheduled basis.</li>
              <li>Hosting an API such as a REST or SOAP service that dynamically
                retrieves individual data and returns a bulk container. This
                approach is useful when for capturing a snapshot of the data.
                The API can also be useful for consumers to customize what they
                want included or excluded. </li>
              <li>Hosting a database, web page, or SPARQL endpoint that contains
                discoverable metadata [[VOCAB-DCAT]] describing the container

            <p>Considering RESTful architectural aspects when designing an APIs
              can guarantee easier development, use of pre-existing
              infrastructure (the Web), a shorter learning curve for developers
              that want to build applications that access data. It also assures
              sustainability as "the technologies that make up this foundation
              include the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), Uniform Resource
              Identifier (URI), markup languages such as HTML and XML, and

            <p>APIs are frequently constructed over different approaches, such
              as SOAP. For data on the Web context, the architecture of the Web
              itself described at the documentation of REST architectural style
              offers the same entry for humans and machines to access data. If
              humans already have access to data in URLs, it can be also

            <p>Design always RESTful APIs using HTTP and good pragmatic REST
              principles. There is no unique agreed set of principles for REST
              APIs, some are implicitly defined by the HTTP standard and others
              have emerged on a consensus base or even are still under
              discussion. The following are a set of rules widely adopted so
              far:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Use hierarchical, readable and technology agnostic Uniform
                Resource Identifiers (URIs) to address resources in a consisten
                way.</li>
              <li>Use the URI path to convey your Resources and Collections
                model.</li>
              <li>Use nouns but no verbs (except for Controllers that does not
                involve resources). Use HTTP verbs instead to operate on the
                Collections and Resources.</li>
              <li>Use standard HTTP methods accordingly to their expected
                default behavior. GET method and query parameters should not
                alter the state.</li>
              <li>Use HTTP headers to provide metadata and for the serialization
                of data formats. Support multiple formats.</li>
              <li>Use HTTP status codes (including error codes) accordingly to
                their original purpose.</li>
              <li>Simplify associations. Use query parameters to hide complexity
                and provide filtering, sorting, field selection and paging for
                collections.</li>
              <li>Version your API. Never release an API without a version and

            <p> The presence of real-time data on the web enables access to
              critical time sensitive data, and encourages the development of
              real-time web applications. Real-time access is dependent on
              real-time data producers making their data readily available to
              the data publisher. The necessity of providing real-time access
              for a given application will need to be evaluated on a case by
              case basis considering refresh rates, latency introduced by data
              post processing steps, infrastructure availability, and the data
              needed by consumers. In addition to making data accessible, data
              publishers may provide additional information describing data
              gaps, data errors and anomolies, and publication delays.</p>

              real-time means a range from milliseconds to a few seconds after

            <ul>
              <li> Push - as data is produced the producers communicates data to
                the data publisher either by disseminating data to the publisher
                or making storage available accessible to the data producer.</li>
              <li>On-Demand (Pull) - available real-time data is made available
                upon request. In this case, data publishers will provide an API
                to facilitate these read-only requests.</li>
            </ul>
            In addition to data access, to ensure credibility providing access
            to error conditions, anomolies, and instrument "house keeping" data
            enhance real-time applications ability to interpret and convey
            real-time data quality to consumers.

            To adequately test real time data access, data will need to be
            tracked from the time it is initially collected to the time it is
            published and accessed. [[PROV-O]] can be used to describe these
            activities. Caution should be used when analyzing real-time access
            for systems that consist of multiple computer systems. For example,
            tests that rely on wall clock time stamps may reflect inconsistences
            between the individual computer systems as opposed to data
            publication time latency. </section>

        <p>Data preservation is a well understood and commonly performed task          for static and self-contained data. This commonly includes the          following steps:</p>        <ul>          <li>ingest the data and assign a persistent identifier to it;</li>          <li>ensure the data is correctly stored and prevent bit rot;</li>          <li>provide access to the data and perform format translation if            needed.</li>        </ul>        <p>The model most commonly referred to is the Open Archival Information          System [[OAIS]]. Many digital preservation institutions are          implementing this model or some variant of it. Web pages can be          preserved following the same strategies, considering a Web site as a          static data set that is self-contained and can be preserved as a snap          shot at a fixed time. When preserving data on the Web some new          elements have to be taken into account:</p>        <ul>          <li>the persistent re-use (URIs) used across the Web may be related to            live data that can change;</li>          <li>the meaning of a resource is contextualized by the other resources            it is linked to;</li>          <li>documents fetched in HTML, RDF/XML of JSON, for instance, are only            one of the many possible serializations of the data they represent.</li>        </ul>        <p>The preservation of Web data should generally focus on the          preservation of the description of entities.</p>        -->

              Linking preserved datasets with the original URI inform the data
              consumer of the status of these resources.</p>
            <p>During its life cycle a dataset may undergo several
              modifications. Although URIs assigned to things are not expected
              to change, the description of these resource will evolve over
              time.
              <!--There are also some new IRIs that will be put into use, some
              other that will become deprecated, and some that will get deleted. -->
              During this evolution, several snapshots could be made available
              for preservation and access as versions.</p>

            <p class="subhead">Intended Outcome</p>
            <p>A link is maintained between the URI of a resource, the most
              up-to-date description available for it, and preserved
              descriptions. If the resource does not exist any more the
              description should say so and refer to the last preserved
              description that was available.</p>
          </section>
          <section class="how">
            <p class="subhead">Possible Approach to Implementation</p>
            <p>There is a variety of HTTP status codes that could be put into
              use to relate the URI with its preserved description. In
              particular, 200, 410 and 303 can be used for different scenarios:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>200 =&gt; there is a new description which contains pointers
                to archived description</li>
              <!--              <li>404 =&gt; the resource just died, the URI consumer has to go
                find an archive to look for it</li> -->
              <li>410 =&gt; the resource is no longer available but it has been
                removed under a controlled process cf. 404 which simply states
                that something is not available.</li>
              <li>303 =&gt; the resource identified by this URI is no longer
                served here but there is a preserved description at a different
                location.</li>
              <!--              <li>209 =&gt; this resource does not exist any more but we have
                some information about it. The description could include a list                of locations having different preserved descriptions over                different times.</li> -->
            </ul>
            <p>In addition to the status codes, HTTP Link headers can also be
              used to relate resources to preserved descriptions.</p>

        <h3>Feedback</h3>
        <p>Publishing data on the Web enables data sharing on a large scale,
          providing data access to a wide range of audiences with different
          levels of expertise. Data publishers want to ensure that the data
          published is meeting the data consumer needs and user feedback is
          crucial. Feedback has benefits for both data publishers and data
          consumers, helping data publishers to improve the integrity of their
          published data, as well as to encourage the publication of new data.
          Feedback allows data consumers to have a voice describing usage
          experiences (e.g. applications using data), preferences and needs.
          When possible, feedback should also be publicly available for other
          data consumers to examine. Making feedback publicly available allows
          users to become aware of other data consumers, supports a
          collaborative environment, and allows user community experiences,
          concerns or questions are currently being addressed.</p>
        <p>From a user interface perspective there are different ways to gather
          feedback from data consumers, including site registration, contact
          forms, quality ratings selection, surveys and comment boxes for
          blogging. From a machine perspective the data publisher can also
          record metrics on data usage or information about specific
          applications consumers are currently relying upon. Feedback such as
          this establishes a line of communication channel between data
          publishers and data consumers. In order to quantify and analyze usage
          feedback, it should be recorded in a machine-readable format. Blogs
          and other publicly available feedback should be displayed in a
          human-readable form through the user interface. </p>
        <p> This section provides some BP to be followed by data publishers in
          order to enable data consumers to provide feedback about the consumed
          data. This feedback can be for humans or machines. </p>

            <p>Examples of file formats: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_file#.TXT">txt</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Document_Format">pdf</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postscript">ps</a>,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_Video_Interleave">avi</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GIF">gif</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG">jpg</a>

              Machine Readable Data are data formats that may be readily parsed by computer programs without access to proprietary libraries. For example <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values">CSV</a> and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/NOTE-rdf11-primer-20140624/#section-graph-syntax">RDF turtle family for graphs</a> are machine readable, but <a href="http://www.data.gov/developers/blog/primer-machine-readability-online-documents-and-data">PDF</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG">JPEG</a> are not.

               Vocabulary is A collection of "terms" for a particular purpose. Vocabularies can range from simple such as the widely used <a href="">RDF Schema</a>, <a href="http://xmlns.com/foaf/spec/">Foaf</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin_Core#Dublin_Core_Metadata_Element_Set_Version_1.1">Dublin Core Metadata Element Set</a> to complex vocabularies with thousands of terms, such as those used in healthcare to describe symptoms, diseases and treatments. Vocabularies play a very important role in Linked Data, specifically to help with data integration. The use of this term overlaps with Ontology.</p>
