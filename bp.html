      <p>This document provides best practices related to the publication and usage
        of data on the Web designed to help support a self-sustaining ecosystem. 
        Data should be discoverable and understandable by humans and machines. 
        Where data is used in some way, whether by the originator of the data or by an external party,
        such usage should also be discoverable and the efforts of the data publisher recognized. 
        In short, following these best practices will facilitate interaction between publishers and consumers.</p>

      <p>This early version of the document shows its expected scope and future direction. A
      template is used that shows the what, why and how of each best practice. Comments are sought on the
      usefulness of this approach and the expected scope of the final document.</p>

    <section id="intro" class="informative">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Data on the Web Best Practices have been developed to encourage and enable 
      the continued expansion of the Web as a medium for the exchange of data. 
      The growth of open data by governments across the world [[OKFN-INDEX]], the increasing
      publication of research data encouraged by organizations like the Research Data Alliance [[RDA]], 
      the harvesting and analysis of social media, crowd-sourcing of information, 
      the provision of important cultural heritage collections such as at the
      Biblioth√®que nationale de France [[BNF]] and the
      sustained growth in the Linked Open Data Cloud [[LODC]], provide some examples 
      of this phenomenon.<p>
      <p>In broad terms, data publishers aim to share data either openly or through 
        a paywall/firewall. Data consumers (who may also be producers themselves)
        want to be able to find and use data, especially if it is accurate, regularly 
        updated and guaranteed to be available at all times. This creates a fundamental need for 
        a common understanding between data publishers and data
        consumers. Without this agreement, data publishers' efforts may be
        incompatible with data consumers' desires.</p>
      <p>Publishing data on the Web creates new challenges, such as how to
        represent, describe and make data available in a way that it
        will be easy to find and to understand. In this context, it becomes crucial to
        provide guidance to publishers that will improve consistency in the way
        data is managed, thus promoting the reuse of data and also to foster
        trust in the data among developers, whatever technology they choose to
        use, increasing the potential for genuine innovation.</p>
      <p>This document sets out a series of best practices that will 
        help publishers and consumers face the new challenges and opportunities
        posed by data on the Web. These best practices
        are organized around the different phases of the Data on the Web
        lifecycle, which provides a framework for considering the several tasks that
        will need to be performed on a dataset throughout its life on the Web. As
        proposed by [[MOLLER]], data is a living thing that moves through
        various stages, such as creation, publishing, use or termination.</p>
      <p>Best practices cover different aspects related to data publishing and
        consumption, like data formats, data access, data identification and
        metadata. In order to delimit the scope and elicit the required features
        for Data on the Web Best Practices, the <acronym title="Data on the Web Best Practices">DWBP</acronym>
        working group compiled a set of use cases [[UCR]]
        that represent scenarios of how data is commonly published on the Web
        and how it is used. The set of requirements derived from these use cases
        were used to guide the development of the best practice.</p>

      <h2>Audience</h2>
      <p>This document provides guidance to those who publish data on the Web,
        as well as those who consume data on the Web. These best practices have
        been written to meet the needs of many different audiences from
        developers and information management staff to scientists interested in
        sharing and reusing research data on the Web. Every attempt has been made to make the
        document as readable and usable as possible while still retaining the
        accuracy and clarity needed in a technical specification.</p>
      <p>Readers of this document are expected to be familiar with some
        fundamental concepts of the architecture of the Web [[WEBARCH]], such as
        resources and URIs, as well as a number of data formats. The normative element of each
        best practice is the <em>intended outcome</em>. Possible implementations are
      suggested and, where appropriate, these recommend the use of a particular
      technology such as CSV, JSON or RDF. A basic
        knowledge of vocabularies and data models would be helpful to better
        understand some aspects of this document.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="scope" class="informative">
      <h2>Scope</h2>
      <p>This document is concerned solely with best practices that:</p><ul>
        <li>are unique to publishing or reusing data on the Web;</li>
        <li>encourage publication or reuse of data on the Web;</li>
        <li>can be tested by machines, humans or a combination of the two.</li></ul>
      <p>As noted above, whether a best practice has or has not been followed should
        be judged against the <em>intended outcome</em>, not the specific
        implementation which is offered as guidance. A
        best practice is always subject to improvement as we learn and evolve
        the Web together.</p>

        <h2>Data on the Web Challenges</h2>
        <p>The openness and flexibility of the Web creates new challenges for
          data publishers and data consumers. In contrast to conventional
          databases, for example, where there's is a single data model to
          represent the data and a database management system (DBMS) to control
          data access, data on the Web allows for the existence of multiple ways to represent
          and to access data. Furthermore, publishers and consumers
          may be unknown to each other and be part of entirely disparate communities with
          different norms and in-built assumptions so that it becomes essential to provide
          information about data structure, quality, provenance and any terms of use.
          The following list summarizes some of the main challenges faced when publishing or
          consuming data on the Web. These challenges were identified from the
          <abbr title="Data on the Web Best Practices">DWBP</abbr> Use Cases and 
          Requirements [[UCR]] and are described by one or more questions.</p>

        <h2>Data on the Web Lifecycle</h2>
        <p>Literature presents a lot of proposals for data lifecycles ranging
          from multimedia data [[HARDMAN]] to digital libraries [[LIFECYC]]. Knud M√∂ller
          [[MOLLER]] presents a survey of lifecycle models for data-centric
          domains as well as an Abstract Data Lifecycle Model (<abbr title="Abstract Data Lifecycle Model">ADLM</abbr>)
          comprising a set of phases, features and roles that can be used to
          classify and compare existing lifecycle models. ADLM also provides the
          basis to construct new lifecycle models for data-centric domains.
          Following this pattern, a generic lifecycle model for data-centric
          domains comprises the following main phases: <em>Ontology
            development</em>, <em>Planning</em>, <em>Creation</em>, <em>Archiving</em>,
          <em>Refinement</em>, <em>Publication</em>, <em>Access</em>, <em>External
            use</em>, <em>Feedback</em> and <em>Termination</em>.</p>
        <p>The Data on the Web lifecycle used in this document is an instance of an
          <abbr title="Abstract Data Lifecycle Model">ADLM</abbr>. In what follows, 
          the ADLM phases are revisited and defined
          according to the data on the Web context. It is important to note that
          the ontology development phase is not included, since it is considered
          an independent phase that can take place <i>a priori</i>.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><em>Planning</em>: this phase concerns the moment when the intent
            to publish data on the Web takes a concrete form. It also comprises
            the selection of data to be published.</li>
          <li><em>Creation</em>: defines the moment when new data is created. It
            means that the data did not previously exist on the Web.</li>
          <li><em>Archiving</em>: this phase concerns the process of anchoring a
            piece of data within the system by the means of indexing,
            cataloging or a similar activity.</li>
          <li><em>Refinement</em>: this phase covers all kinds of activities
            that make additions or changes to data that already exist on the
            Web.</li>
          <li><em>Publication</em>: this phase concerns the moment when data is
            made accessible on the Web.</li>
          <li><em>Access</em>: denotes the moment in the lifecycle when users
            gain access to the data available on the Web.</li>
          <li><em>External use</em>: implies that the user performs some further
            actions to create visualizations or to perform data analysis, for
            example.</li>
          <li><em>Feedback</em>: allows users to comment on the data or metadata
            available on the Web they have previously accessed and used.</li>
          <li><em>Termination</em>: presents the moment when data is removed
            from the Web.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>As proposed in [[MOLLER]], the data on the Web lifecycle model is an
          evolving one, since there is no restriction for data to pass through
          all phases of the lifecycle before the start of a new iteration,
          neither a specific point of the lifecyle to begin with.</p>
        <p>In the data on the Web context, two main roles may be played by
          actors in the lifecycle: data publisher and data consumer. The data
          publisher role may be played by several actors who are responsible for
          performing actions like data and metadata creation, and data
          publication and archiving. The data consumer are those actors who
          receive and consume the data. Of course consumers may well also be publishers.</p>

      <h2>The Best Practices</h2>
      <section id="dataCreation">
        <h3>Best Practices for Data Creation and Publication</h3>
        <div class="issue">Intro to data organization section here.</div>
        <section id="metadata">
          <h4>Metadata</h4>
          <p>The data on the Web ecosystem has an underlying architecture that
            involves actors with different roles. Primary among these are the roles of
            data <em>publisher</em> and data <em>consumer</em> but this suggests a clear boundary
            between the two that may not exist or be helpful. For example, a data <em>broker</em> would
            consume data, process and/or enrich it in some way and then re-publish it, perhaps
            charging a fee for the service.</p>
          <p>The data itself is a central entity in this ecosystem, but on its own it
            is likely to be hard to use if not completely useless. In order to help the consumer to discover and 
            understand data sufficiently to be able to use it in some way requires
            more data about the data, that is, metadata.</p>
          <p>Metadata is a complex topic in its own right. It exists at
            different levels of granularity that go from a single property of 
            a resource to a whole dataset, or all datasets from a specific organization.
            It supports multiple tasks including dataset discovery and dataset structure.
            Data consumers may aggregate metadata about, for example, data usage, 
            generating feedback to data providers that might meet more needs of more users 
            and to help improve data quality. And it's metadata that describes the 
            license and terms of use, the organization that generated the data, 
            the data quality, the update schedule etc.</p>

<div class="issue">Should the following 2 paragraphs become best practices?</div>

          <p>Metadata can be provided in two forms: human-readable and
            machine-readable. It is important to provide both forms of metadata
            in order to reach humans and applications. In the case of
            machine-readable metadata, the use of standard vocabularies should
            be encouraged as a way of enhancing common semantics. For example,
            data provenance could be described using PROV-O, a W3C
            Recommendation that provides a set of classes, properties, and
            restrictions that can be used to represent and interchange
            provenance information generated in different systems and under
            different contexts.</p>
          <p>Metadata can be of different types. These types can be classified
            in different taxonomies, with different grouping criterias. For
            example, a specific taxonomy could define three metadata types
            according to descriptive, structural and administrative features.
            Descriptive metadata serves to identify a dataset, structural
            metadata serves to understand the format that the dataset is
            distributed and administrative metadata serves to provide
            information about version, update schedule, etc. A different
            taxonomy could define metadata types with a scheme according to
            tasks where metadata are used, for example, discovery and reuse.</p>
          <p>This document specifies the intended outcomes for each best
            practice and then gives some guidance on possible implementation methods.
            In terms of metadata, the particular implementation method will depend 
            on the format of the dataset distribution, for example, metadata
            describing a CSV file should be provided in a different way than for
            an RDF dataset. However, the <em>intention</em> is the same irrespective
            of format.</p>

            Dublin Core Metadata set [[DC-TERMS]] that provides common terms such as 
            title, date, description, creator etc.</li>
            <li>Use an appropriate metadata schema to describe the <strong>structure of the dataset</strong>. Examples include:<ul>
              <li>Metadata Vocabulary for Tabular Data for <abbr title="Comma Separataed Variables">CSV</abbr> files [[TABULAR-METADATA]]</li>
              <li>Use the Vocabulary of Interlinked Datasets (VoID) for RDF datasets [[VOID]]</li>
            </ul></li>
            <li>Use the <code>dcterms:license</code> or <code>dcterms:rights</code> to link a dataset to license and/or rights information. (@@@Not at all sure this is universally agreed!@@@)</li></ul>

          <p> Best practices on data formats include considerations on making data available in multiple open and machine
            readable formats for example RDF and JSON. In addition this section will include guidance on preferred data 
            formats for example preferred formats for date, string and numbers. Guidance will also be provided on expressing 
            data in multiple languages. While mentioned in the use case document as challenge, the best practices document 
            should not make recommendations regarding the formats of source data for example database dumps,
            spreadsheets. It is expected that data sources for data on the web will continue to be in multiple formats.</p>

        <section id="dataVocabularies">
          <h4>Data Vocabularies</h4>
          <p>Datasets often resort to a range of vocabularies in the data they contain: data values are entered or captured in a controlled way, i.e., for certain positions in a data graph (or column in a relationship table), the value used should come with a limited set of pre-existing resources: for example object types, roles of a person, countries in a geographic area, or possible subjects for books.
Such vocabularies aim to represent a set of terms and the relationship among them, in order to ensure a level of control, standardization and interoperability in the data. They can also provide a way to easily create richer data. Say, a dataset contain one reference in a data statement to a concept description in several languages. This single statement allows applications to localize their display of their search depending on the language of the user. The vocabularies can also have different forms (e.g. thesaurus, taxonomy, semantic network) and be represented in different formats (e.g. RDF, OWL, JSON, CSV).
This section presents best practices for data vocabularies accessible as URI sets on the Web. It focuses on the description of Best Practices to two different types of audiences: publishers and consumers of data vocabularies. </p>

        </section>
        <section id="dataPreservation">
        <h4> Data Preservation </h4>
          <p>Data preservation is a well understood and commonly performed tasks
            for static and self-contained data. This commonly includes the
            following steps:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Ingest the data and assign a persistent identifier to it</li>
            <li>Ensure the data is correctly stored and prevent bit rot</li>
            <li>Provide access to the data and perform format translation if
              needed</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The model most commonly referred to is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Archival_Information_System">
              Open Archival Information System</a>. Many institutions taking
            care of digital preservation are implementing this model or some
            variant of it. Web pages can be preserved following the same
            strategies, considering a web site as a static data set that is
            self-contained and can be all snap-shoted and preserved at a fixed
            time. When it comes to Web data some new elements have to be taken
            into account, namely:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The persistent identifiers (IRI) used across the web are related
              to live data that can change</li>
            <li>The meaning of a resource is contextualized by the other
              resources it is linked to</li>
            <li>Documents fetched in HTML, RDF of JSON, for instance, are only
              one of the many possible serialisation of the data they represent</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The two following sections tackle requirements for the digital
            archive and the data depositors of Web data.</p>
          <h5>Digital trusted repositories</h5>
          <div class="practice">

            <section class="axioms">
              <p class="subhead">Why</p>
              <p>Web data is about the description of resources identified with
                a IRI. It is to be expected that queries made by data consumers
                will resolve around finding a preserved description of a
                particular resource.</p>

              <p class="subhead">Why</p>
              <p>A chunk of Web data is by definition dependent on the rest of
                the global graph. This global context influences the meaning of
                the description of the resources found in the dataset. Ideally,
                the preservation of a particular dataset would involve
                preserving all its context. That is the entire Web of Data.</p>

              <p>At ingestion time an evaluation of the linkage of Web data
                dataset dump to already preserved resources is assessed. The
                presence of all the vocabularies and target resources in uses is
                sought in a set of digital archives taking care of preserving
                Web data. Datasets for which very few of the vocabularies used
                and/or resources pointed out are already preserved somewhere
