      <p>This document provides best practices related to the publication and
        usage of data on the Web designed to help support a self-sustaining
        ecosystem. Data should be discoverable and understandable by humans and
        machines. Where data is used in some way, whether by the originator of
        the data or by an external party, such usage should also be discoverable
        and the efforts of the data publisher recognized. In short, following
        these best practices will facilitate interaction between publishers and
        consumers.</p>

      <p>This early version of the document shows its expected scope and future
        direction. A template is used that shows the what, why and how of each
        best practice. Comments are sought on the usefulness of this approach
        and the expected scope of the final document.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="intro" class="informative">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <div class="note">
        <p>This is the first working draft of this document to be formally
          published and all text is explicitly open to review. In this first
          version, 29 best practices are proposed and more than 25 requirements
          have been addressed. However, there are still many ongoing discussions
          in the group about important subjects, like terminology and scope. The
          group is still working towards consensus on the meaning and
          application of some important terms including: vocabulary, metadata,
          data model, data format, schema and dataset. Other important issues
          relate to the definition of best practices for vocabularies. For
          example it is not clear if providing advice to data publishers to
          create and re-use vocabularies is in the scope of the <abbr title="Data on the Web Best Practices">DWBP</abbr>.
          Likewise, there is not yet consensus on whether data preservation is
          in scope. The Working Group is therefore particularly keen to receive
          comments to ensure that its future work is relevant, useful and
          comprehensive. Please send comments to <a href="mailto:public-dwbp-wg@w3.org">public-dwbp-wg@w3.org</a>
          (<a href="mailto:public-dwbp-wg-request@w3.org?subject=subscribe">subscribe</a>,
          <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-dwbp-wg/">archives</a>).</p>
      </div>
      <p>The best practices described below have been developed to encourage and
        enable the continued expansion of the Web as a medium for the exchange
        of data. The growth of open data by governments across the world
        [[OKFN-INDEX]], the increasing publication of research data encouraged
        by organizations like the Research Data Alliance [[RDA]], the harvesting
        and analysis of social media, crowd-sourcing of information, the
        provision of important cultural heritage collections such as at the
        Bibliothèque nationale de France [[BNF]] and the sustained growth in the
        Linked Open Data Cloud [[LODC]], provide some examples of this
        phenomenon.</p>
      <p>In broad terms, data publishers aim to share data either openly or with
        controlled access. Data consumers (who may also be producers themselves)
        want to be able to find and use data, especially if it is accurate,
        regularly updated and guaranteed to be available at all times. This
        creates a fundamental need for a common understanding between data
        publishers and data consumers. Without this agreement, data publishers'
        efforts may be incompatible with data consumers' desires.</p>
      <p>Publishing data on the Web creates new challenges, such as how to
        represent, describe and make data available in a way that it will be
        easy to find and to understand. In this context, it becomes crucial to
        provide guidance to publishers that will improve consistency in the way
        data is managed, thus promoting the re-use of data and also to foster
        trust in the data among developers, whatever technology they choose to
        use, increasing the potential for genuine innovation.</p>
      <p>This document sets out a series of best practices that will help
        publishers and consumers face the new challenges and opportunities posed
        by data on the Web. </p>
      <p>Best practices cover different aspects related to data publishing and
        consumption, like data formats, data access, data identification and
        metadata. In order to delimit the scope and elicit the required features
        for Data on the Web Best Practices, the <abbr title="Data on the Web Best Practices">DWBP</abbr>
        working group compiled a set of use cases [[UCR]] that represent
        scenarios of how data is commonly published on the Web and how it is
        used. The set of requirements derived from these use cases were used to
        guide the development of the best practice.</p>
      <p>The Best Practices proposed in this document are intended to serve a
        more general purpose than the practices suggested in Best Practices for
        Publishing Linked Data [[LD-BP]] since it is domain-independent and
        whilst it recommends the use of Linked Data, it also promotes best
        practices for data on the web in formats such as [[CSV]] and [[JSON]].
        The Best Practices related to the use of vocabularies incorporate
        practices that stem from Best Practices for Publishing Linked Data where
        appropriate.<!-- While
        that document was published in its final version by the Government Linked        Data Working Group as a Working Group Note, the charter of the Data on        the Web Best Practices (DWBP) Working Group advances that this document        should be published ultimately as a W3C Recommendation.--></p>

      <h2>Audience</h2>
      <p>This document provides best practices to those who publish data on the
        Web. The best practices are designed to meet the needs of information
        management staff, developers, and wider groups such as scientists
        interested in sharing and re-using research data on the Web. While data
        publishers are our primary audience, we encourage all those engaged in
        related activities to become familiar with it. Every attempt has been
        made to make the document as readable and usable as possible while still
        retaining the accuracy and clarity needed in a technical specification.</p>
      <p>Readers of this document are expected to be familiar with some
        fundamental concepts of the architecture of the Web [[!WEBARCH]], such
        as resources and URIs, as well as a number of data formats. The
        normative element of each best practice is the <em>intended outcome</em>.
        Possible implementations are suggested and, where appropriate, these
        recommend the use of a particular technology such as <abbr title="Comma Separataed Variables">CSV</abbr>,
        JSON or RDF. A basic knowledge of vocabularies and data models would be
        helpful to better understand some aspects of this document. </p>
    </section>
    <section id="scope" class="informative">
      <h2>Scope</h2>
      <p>This document is concerned solely with best practices that:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>are specifically relevant to data published on the Web;</li>
        <li>encourage publication or re-use of data on the Web;</li>
        <li>can be tested by machines, humans or a combination of the two.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>As noted above, whether a best practice has or has not been followed
        should be judged against the <em>intended outcome</em>, not the
        specific implementation which is offered as guidance. A best practice is
        always subject to improvement as we learn and evolve the Web together.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section id="context" class="informative">
      <h2>Context</h2>
      <p> In general, publishing data on the Web means to publish datasets on
        the Web in order to share data with multiple users. For this document,
        as defined by [[DCAT]], "a dataset is a collection of data, available
        for access or download in one or more formats". By data, "we mean known
        facts that can be recorded and that have implicit meaning" [[Navathe]].</p>
      <p> In order to deal with data changes and to keep different data
        versions, multiple versions may be created for a single dataset. In the
        same way, to meet the requirements of different users, a single dataset
        may be available in different data formats. The publication of a dataset
        in a specific data format (ex: csv or json) is called distribution. </p>
      <p> To illustrate these concepts let us consider a simple example: a
        dataset that collects data about weekly weather forecast of MyCity. The
        following figure shows the relation between the dataset (Dataset001) and
        its different versions (Dataset001_W1, Dataset001_W2, Dataset001_W3 and
        Dataset001_W4), where each version corresponds to the weather forecast
        of a week of May 2015. Each dataset version has two different
        distributions: one in csv and one in json. For example, the version
        Dataset001_W1 has two distributions: Dataset001_W1_csv and
        Dataset001_W1_json. </p>

        <h2>Data on the Web Challenges</h2>
        <p>The openness and flexibility of the Web creates new challenges for
          data publishers and data consumers. In contrast to conventional
          databases, for example, where there is a single data model to
          represent the data and a database management system (DBMS) to control
          data access, data on the Web allows for the existence of multiple ways
          to represent and to access data. Furthermore, publishers and consumers
          may be unknown to each other and be part of entirely disparate
          communities with different norms and in-built assumptions so that it
          becomes essential to provide information about data structure,
          quality, provenance and any terms of use. The following diagram
          summarizes some of the main challenges faced when publishing or
          consuming data on the Web. These challenges were identified from the <abbr

            title="Data on the Web Best Practices">DWBP</abbr> Use Cases and
          Requirements [[UCR]] and are described by one or more questions. 
          As presented in the diagram, each one of these challenges is addressed by one or more best practice.</p>
       
        <img alt="Data on the Web Challenges" src="images/DW_Challenges.svg">
        
        
        <p> Each one of these challenges originated one or more requirements as
          documented in <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp-ucr/#requirements">the
            use-cases document</a>. The development of Data on the Web Best
          Practices were guided by these requirements, in such a way that each
          best practice should have at least one of these requirements as an
          evidence of its relevance.</p>

      <p>This section contains the best practices to be used by data publishers
        in order to help them and data consumers to overcome the different
        challenges faced when publishing and consuming data on the Web. One or

        <p> This example serves as a basis for elaboration that will be
          described in subsequent sections. It helps to illustrate how best
          practices can be applied </p>
        <div class="example">
          <p> John works for the Transport Agency of MyCity and he is in charge
            of the publication of data on the Web about bus timetables as well
            as real time data about the traffic of the city. John decides to
            create two datasets: one for the bus timetables and other one for
            the real time traffic data. </p>

        When necessary RDF examples will be used to show the result of the
        application of some best practices. RDF examples in this document are
        written in Turtle syntax [[TURTLE]] and [[JSON-LD]]. </section>
      <section id="metadata">
        <h3>Metadata</h3>
        <p>The Web is an open information space, where the absence of a specific
          context, such a company's internal information system, becomes
          metadata a fundamental requirement. Data will not be discoverable or
          reusable by anyone other than the publisher if insufficient metadata
          is provided. Metadata provides additional information that helps data
          consumers better understand the meaning of data, its structure, and to
          clarify other issues, such as rights and license terms, the
          organization that generated the data, data quality, data access
          methods and the update schedule of datasets. <br>
        </p>
        Metadata can be used to help tasks such as dataset discovery and re-use,
        and can be assigned considering different levels of granularity from a
        single property of a resource to a whole dataset, or all datasets from a
        specific organization. <br>
        <p>Metadata can be of different types. These types can be classified in
          different taxonomies, with different grouping criteria. For example, a
          specific taxonomy could define three metadata types according to
          descriptive, structural and administrative features. Descriptive
          metadata serves to identify a dataset, structural metadata serves to
          understand the structure in which the dataset is distributed and
          administrative metadata serves to provide information about the
          version, update schedule etc. A different taxonomy could define
          metadata types with a scheme according to tasks where metadata are
          used, for example, discovery and re-use. </p>

              unkown to each other. Then, it is essential to provide information
              that helps data consumers, i.e., human users and computer
              applications, to understand the data as well as other important
              aspects that describes a dataset.</p>

              describes a dataset, which makes it <span style="font-style: italic;">human
                understandable metadata</span>.</p>
            <p>It should be possible for computer applications, notably user

            <p class="subhead">Possible Approach to Implementation</p>
            Possible approaches to provide <em>human understandable metadata:</em><br>
            <ul>
              <li>to provide metadata as part of an HTML Web page</li>
              <li>to provide metadata as a separate text file</li>
            </ul>
            Possible approaches to provide <em>machine readable metadata:</em><br>
            <ul>
              <li> machine readable metadata may be provided in a serialization
                format such as Turtle and JSON, or it can be embedded in the
                HTML page using [[JSON-LD]], or [[HTML-RDFA]] or [[Microdata]].
                If multiple formats are published separately, they should be
                served from the same URL using content negotiation. Maintenance
                of multiple formats is best achieved by generating each
                available format on the fly based on a single source of the
                metadata.</li>

            Date, time, and number formats can have very different meanings,

          <h2>Data Licenses</h2>
          <p>A license is a very useful piece of information to be attached to
            data on the Web. As defined by the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative,
            a license is a legal document giving official permission to do
            something with the data with which it is associated. According to
            the type of license adopted by the publisher, there might be more or
            fewer restrictions on sharing and re-using data. In the context of
            data on the Web, the license of a dataset can be specified within
            the data, or outside of it, in a separate document to which it is
            linked.
            <!--However, in line with the Linked
          Data principles, licenses for such datasets should          be specified in RDF, for instance through the Dublin Core vocabulary          [[DC-TERMS]].</p> -->

          <h3>Data Provenance</h3>
          <p>Provenance originates from the French term "provenir" (to come
            from), which is used to describe the curation process of artwork as
            art is passed from owner to owner. Data provenance, in a similar
            way, is metadata that allows data providers to pass details about
            the data history to data users. Provenance becomes particularly
            important when data is shared between collaborators who might not
            have direct contact with one another either due to proximity or
            because the published data outlives the lifespan of the data
            provider projects or organizations.</p>
          <p>The Web brings together business, engineering, and scientific
            communities creating collaborative opportunities that were
            previously unimaginable. The challenge in publishing data on the Web
            is providing an appropriate level of detail about its origin. The
            data publishers may not necessarily be the data provider and so
            collecting and conveying this corresponding metadata is particularly
            important. Without provenance, consumers have no inherent way to
            trust the integrity and credibility of the data being shared. Data
            publishers in turn need to be aware of the needs of prospective
            consumer communities to know how much provenance detail is
            appropriate. </p>
          <!-- <p>To meet this need, the W3C community offers the Provenance Ontology
            [[PROV-O]] so that data publishers can formally describe data            provenance and methodologies so that consumers can query and use            provenance information. </p> -->

          <h3>Data Quality</h3>
          <p>Data quality is commonly defined as “fitness for use” for a
            specific application or use case. It can affect the potentiality of
            the application that use data, as a consequence, its inclusion in
            the data publishing and consumption pipelines is of primary
            importance.</p>
          <p>Usually, the assessment of quality involves different kinds of
            quality dimensions, each representing groups of characteristics that
            are relevant to publishers and consumers. Measures and metrics are
            defined to assess the quality for each dimension. There are
            heuristics designed to fit specific assessment situations that rely
            on quality indicators, namely, pieces of data content, pieces of
            data meta-information, and human ratings that give indications about
            the suitability of data for some intended use.</p>
          <!--<p>Dimensions and metrics to adopt might largely depend on the
            specific application scenario, or even on the data domain. A            systematic review of dimensions, metrics adopted in the context of            Linked Open Data can be found in the recent literature (e.g., see            [[ZAVERI]]). </p> -->

          <h3>Data Versioning</h3>
          <p>Data on the web often changes over time. Many datasets are updated
            on a scheduled basis, such as census data or funding data that
            changes every fiscal year. Other datasets are changed as
            improvements in collecting the data make updates worthwhile. Still
            other data changes in real time or near real time. All these types
            of data need a consistent, informative approach to versioning, so
            that data consumers can understand and work with the changing data.
            The following best practices address issues that arise in tracking
            and managing different versions of datasets.</p>

              <p>Version information makes a dataset uniquely identifiable.
                Uniqueness can be used by data consumers to determine how data
                has changed over time and to determine specifically which
                version of a dataset they are working with. Good data versioning
                enables consumers to understand if a newer version of a dataset
                is available. Explicit versioning allows for repeatability in
                research, enables comparisons, and prevents confusion. Using
                unique version numbers that follow a standardized approach can
                also set consumer expectations about how the versions differ.</p>

                <li>Include a unique version number as part of the metadata for

                <li>Use a consistent numbering scheme with a meaningful approach
                  to incrementing digits, such as [[SchemaVer]]. </li>
                <li>Provide a description of what has changed since the previous
                  version. </li>
                <li>If the data is made available through an API, the URI used
                  to request the latest version of the data should not change as
                  the versions change, but it should be possible to request a

        <p>Identifiers are simple conventions of labels that allow us to
          distinguish what is being identified from anything else. Identifiers
          have being extensively used in every information system, making it
          possible to refer to any particular element. On the Web, a friendly
          and uniform system of identification will be required to enable data

            <p class="subhead">Possible Approach to Implementation</p>
            <p>The architecture of the World Wide Web [[WEBARCH]] is based on
              links between resources based on globally unique identifiers. They
              can identify people, places and concepts just as much as the more
              familiar <abbr title="Uniform Resource Location">URL</abbr>
              identifiers for Web pages, images etc. HTTP <abbr title="Internationalized Resource Identifier">IRI</abbr>s,
              the internationalized version of <abbr title="Uniform Resource Identifier">URI</abbr>s,
              themselves a super-set of URLs, are a fundamental aspect of the
              Web.</p>
            <p>Internationalized Resource Identifiers (IRIs) [[!RFC3987]] should
              be used when needed. The use of URI or IRIs depends on the
              intended audience. For global audience one should use language and
              cultural neutral URIs; for local audience one could use IRIs.</p>
            <pre title="URI and IRIs" class="highlight example">              http://example.com/中国                  # For Chinese speaker: good mnemonic - non-Chinese speakers: bad mnemonic
              http://example.com/china                 # For Chinese speaker: acceptable - non-Chinese speakers: better
            </pre>
            <p>Some best practices to adopt while using URIs as a data
              identification system:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Associate every data, or dataset, resource with an unique
                identifier using a representational URI.</li>
              <li>Use the HTTP protocol to ensure that the resolution of any URI
                on the Web is possible.</li>
              <li>When someone looks up an identifier URI, always provide useful
                information or metadata.</li>
              <li>Build standard URIs that follow a well-defined and extensible
                scheme or pattern to provide consistency and uniformity.</li>
              <li>Avoid broken URIs. In the event that a resource has been
                modified or deleted, those changes must be communicated using
                the appropriate response code [[RFC7231]]. If the resource has
                changed location, HTTP 3XX codes should be used, whereas if the
                resource has been deleted a HTTP 410 code should be used. See
                the best practice on <a href="#resourcestatus">statuses</a> for
                more information</li>
              <li>Do not expose information on the technical implementation of
                the resources represented within the URI. Any information about
                the underlying technology should be omitted (e.g. file
                extensions).</li>

        <p>The formats in which data is made available to consumers are a key
          aspect of making that data usable. The best, most flexible access
          mechanism in the world is pointless unless it serves data in formats
          that enable use and reuse. Below we detail best practices in selecting
          formats for your data, both at the level of files and that of
          individual fields. W3C encourages use of formats that can be used by
          the widest possible audience and processed most readily by computing
          systems. Source formats, such as database dumps or spreadsheets, used
          to generate the final published format, are out of scope. This

              severe limitations on the continuing usefulness of the data. Using

        <p>Data is often represented in a structured and controlled way, making
          reference to a range of vocabularies, for example, by defining types
          of nodes and links in a data graph or types of values for columns in a
          table, such as the subject of a book, or a relationship “knows”
          between two persons. Additionally, the values used may come from a
          limited set of pre-existing values or resources: for example object
          types, roles of a person, countries in a geographic area, or possible
          subjects for books. Such vocabularies ensure a level of control,
          standardization and interoperability in the data. They can also serve
          to improve the usability of datasets. Say, a dataset contains a
          reference to a concept described in several languages. Such reference
          allows applications to localize their display of their search
          depending on the language of the user. </p>
        <p>According to W3C, <a href="http://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/ontology">vocabularies</a>
          define the concepts and relationships (also referred to as “terms”)
          used to describe and represent an area of concern. Vocabularies are
          used to classify the terms that can be used in a particular
          application, characterize possible relationships, and define possible
          constraints on using those terms. Several categories of vocabularies
          have been coined, for example, ontology, controlled vocabularies,
          thesaurus, taxonomy, semantic network.</p>

          these names. “Ontology” tends however to denote the vocabularies of
          classes and properties that structure the descriptions of resources in
          (linked) datasets. In relational databases, these correspond to the
          names of tables and columns; in XML, they correspond to the elements
          defined by an XML Schema. Ontologies are the key building blocks for
          inference techniques on the Semantic Web. The first means offered by
          W3C for creating ontologies is the RDF Schema [[RDF-SCHEMA]] language.
          It is possible to define more expressive ontologies with additional
          axioms using languages such as those in The Web Ontology Language
          [[OWL2-OVERVIEW]]. </p>
        <p>On the other hand, “controlled vocabularies”, “concept schemes”,
          “knowledge organization systems” enumerate and define resources that
          can be employed in the descriptions made with the former kind of
          vocabulary. A concept from a thesaurus, say, “architecture”, will for
          example be used in the subject field for a book description (where
          “subject” has been defined in an ontology for books). For defining the
          terms in these vocabularies, complex formalisms are most often not
          needed. Simpler models have thus been proposed to represent and
          exchange them, such as the ISO 25964 data model [[ISO-25964]] or W3C's
          Simple Knowledge Organization System [[SKOS-PRIMER]].</p>
        <p>This section presents best practices for data vocabularies accessible
          as URI sets on the Web, which are applicable to any kind of
          vocabulary.</p>

            <p>Before defining any new vocabulary, a first preliminary step               is to analyze whether there are any              other public vocabularies that have been previously applied to the              same scope of knowledge we intend to work with. In case we find              any, there are several criteria that we <em class="rfc2119">should</em>              consider to assess the suitability of re-using that vocabulary for              our use case:</p>            <ul>              <li>Frequent use: Although there is an increasingly number of                available vocabularies, just a reduced number of them have been                internationally recognized as standards de jure or de facto.                Common vocabularies greatly facilitate re-use, so we should                prioritize those that have demonstrated previous broad adoption.</li>              <li>Expressiveness: it is important to assess to what extent the                candidate vocabulary may cover all aspects included in our                dataset, as well as whether the expressiveness degree is                sufficient for the disaggregation level of our data.</li>              <li>Activity and maintenance: the vocabulary <em class="rfc2119">should</em>                be actively maintained, and offer a clear policy to collect                feedback and perform updates.</li>              <li>Quality of publication: as per our best practice "Document                vocabularies" above, the vocabularies <em class="rfc2119">should</em>                have sufficient documentation to be able to interpret the                meaning of their elements in a unambiguous way. In addition,                vocabularies that are <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/swbp-vocab-pub/">designed                  and published under the Linked Data paradigm</a> will offer                enhanced reusability.</li>            </ul> -->

            <p>Formal semantics may help one to establish precise specifications

              and the performance of complex tasks such as reasoning. On the
              other hand, complex vocabularies require more effort to produce
              and understand, which could hamper their re-use, as well as the
              comparison and linking of datasets exploiting them. Highly
              formalized data is also harder to exploit by inference engines:
              for example, using an OWL class in a position where a SKOS concept
              is enough, or using OWL classes with complex OWL axioms raises the
              formal complexity of the data according to the OWL Profiles
              [[OWL2-PROFILES]]. Data producers should therefore seek to
              identify the right level of formalization for particular domains,
              audiences and tasks, and maybe offer different formalization
              levels when one size does not fit all.</p>

              dataset. When simpler models are enough to convey the necessary
              semantics, represent vocabularies using them. For instance, for
              Linked Data, SKOS may be preferred for simple vocabularies as

          include personal data, corporate or government data, and mishandling
          of published sensitive data may lead to damages to individuals or
          organizations.</p>
        <p>To support best practices for publishing sensitive data, data
          publishers should identify all sensitive data, assess the exposure
          risk, determine the intended usage, data user audience and any related
          usage policies, obtain appropriate approval, and determine the
          appropriate security measures needed to taken to protect the data.
          Appropriate security measures should also account for secure
          authentication and use of HTTPS.</p>
        <p>At times, because of sharing policies sensitive data may not be
          available in part or in its entirety. Data unavailability represents
          gaps that may affect the overall analysis of datasets. To account for
          unavailable data, data publishers should publish information about
          unavoidable data gaps.</p>

        <h3>Data Access</h3>
        <p>Providing easy access to data on the Web enables both humans and
          machines to take advantage of the benefits of sharing data using the
          Web infrastructure. By default, the Web offers access using Hypertext
          Transfer Protocol (HTTP) methods. This provides access to data at an
          atomic transaction level. However, when data is distributed across
          multiple files or requires more sophisticated retrieval methods
          different approaches can be adopted to enable data access, including
          bulk download and <abbr title="Application Programming Interfaces">API</abbr>s.
          </p>
        <p>One approach is packaging data in bulk using non-proprietary file
          formats(for example zip files or tar files). Using this approach, bulk
          data is generally pre-processed server side where multiple files or
          directory trees of files are provided as one downloadable file. When
          bulk data is being retrieved from non-file system solutions, depending
          on the data user communities, the data publisher can offer APIs to
          support a series of retrieval operations representing a single
          transaction.</p>
        <p>For data that is streaming to the Web in “real time” or “near real
          time”, data publishers should publish data or use APIs to enable
          immediate access to data, allowing access to critical time sensitive
          data, such as emergency information, weather forecasting data, or
          published system metrics. In general, APIs should be available to
          allow third parties to automatically search and retrieve data
          published on the Web. </p>
        <p>On a further note, it can be observed that data on the Web is
          essentially about the description of entities identified by a unique,
          Web-based, identifier (a URI). Once the data is dumped and sent to an
          institute specialised in digital preservation the link with the Web is
          broken (de-referencing) but the role of the URI as a unique identifier
          still remains. In order to increase the usability of preserved dataset
          dumps it is relevant to maintain a list of these identifiers. </p>

          <p class="practicedesc">Data <em class="rfc2119">should</em> be
            available for bulk download. </p>
          <section class="axioms">
            <p class="subhead">Why</p>
            <p>When web data is distributed across many URLs and logically
              organized as one container, accessing the data in bulk is useful.
              Bulk access provides a consistent means to handle the data as one
              container. Without it, individually accessing data is cumbersome
              leading to inconsistent approaches to handling the container.</p>

            <p> It should be possible to download data on the Web in bulk. Data
              publishers should provide a way either through bulk file formats

            <p>Depending on the nature of the data and consumer needs possible
              approaches could include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Preprocessing a copy of the data in compressed archive format
                where the data more easily accessible as one URL. This is
                particularly useful for handling data that changes infrequently
                or on a scheduled basis.</li>
              <li>Hosting an API such as a REST or SOAP service that dynamically
                retrieves individual data and returns a bulk container. This
                approach is useful when for capturing a snapshot of the data.
                The API can also be useful for consumers to customize what they
                want included or excluded. </li>
              <li>Hosting a database, web page, or SPARQL endpoint that contains
                discoverable metadata [[VOCAB-DCAT]] describing the container
                and data URLs associated with the container.</li>

              the use of specific clients or the need of <abbr title="Universal Description, Discovery and Integration">UDDI</abbr>.</p>
            <p>APIs are frequently constructed over different approaches, such
              as SOAP. For data on the Web context, the architecture of the Web
              itself described at the documentation of REST architectural style
              offers the same entry for humans and machines to access data. If
              humans already have access to data in URLs, it can be also

            <ul>
              <li>Use hierarchical, readable and technology agnostic Uniform

              <li>Use standard HTTP methods accordingly to their expected

            To adequately test real time data access, data will need to tracked
            from the time it is initially collected to the time it is published
            and accessed. [[PROV-O]] can be used to describe these activities.
            Caution should be used when analyzing real-time access for systems
            that consist of multiple computer systems. For example, tests that
            rely on wall clock time stamps may reflect inconsistences between
            the individual computer systems as opposed to data publication time
            latency. </section>

              so that older versions remain available under the previous base
              URI. For example, <a href="http://myapi.org/v1/dogs/alfred">http://myapi.org/v1/dogs/alfred</a>
              retrieves the older version of data about a dog named Alfred, and
              <a href="http://myapi.org/v2/dogs/alfred">http://myapi.org/v2/dogs/alfred</a>
              retrieves the newer version of data about Alfred. Keeping the
              version number as far to the left as possible in the API call
              allows developers to switch to the newer version with the least

        <h3>Data Preservation</h3>
        This section describes best practices related to [[data preservation]].
        Albeit being a closely related topic [[data archiving]] is considered
        out of scope for this group and therefor not covered here.
        <!--
        <p>Data preservation is a well understood and commonly performed task          for static and self-contained data. This commonly includes the          following steps:</p>        <ul>          <li>ingest the data and assign a persistent identifier to it;</li>          <li>ensure the data is correctly stored and prevent bit rot;</li>          <li>provide access to the data and perform format translation if            needed.</li>
        </ul>        <p>The model most commonly referred to is the Open Archival Information          System [[OAIS]]. Many digital preservation institutions are          implementing this model or some variant of it. Web pages can be          preserved following the same strategies, considering a Web site as a          static data set that is self-contained and can be preserved as a snap          shot at a fixed time. When preserving data on the Web some new          elements have to be taken into account:</p>
        <ul>          <li>the persistent re-use (URIs) used across the Web may be related to            live data that can change;</li>          <li>the meaning of a resource is contextualized by the other resources            it is linked to;</li>          <li>documents fetched in HTML, RDF/XML of JSON, for instance, are only            one of the many possible serializations of the data they represent.</li>        </ul>
        <p>The preservation of Web data should generally focus on the          preservation of the description of entities.</p>        -->

In order              to increase the usability of preserved dataset dumps it is              relevant to maintain a list of these identifiers.</p>          </section>          <section class="outcome">

            <p>A chunk of Web data is by definition dependent on the rest of the
              global graph. This global context influences the meaning of the
              description of the resources found in the dataset. Ideally, the
              preservation of a particular dataset would involve preserving all
              its context. That is the entire Web of Data. </p>
            <p>At ingestion time an evaluation of the linkage of Web data
              dataset dump to already preserved resources is assessed. The
              presence of all the vocabularies and target resources in uses is
              sought in a set of digital archives taking care of preserving Web
              data. Datasets for which very few of the vocabularies used and/or
              resources pointed out are already preserved somewhere should be
              flagged as being at risk.</p>

            <p>During its life cycle a dataset may undergo several
              modifications. Although URIs assigned to things are not expected

              <!--There are also some new IRIs that will be put into use, some
              other that will become deprecated, and some that will get deleted. -->

        <p>Publishing data on the Web enables data sharing on a large scale,
          providing data access to a wide range of audiences with different
          levels of expertise. Data publishers want to ensure that the data
          published is meeting the data consumer needs and user feedback is
          crucial. Feedback has benefits for both data publishers and data
          consumers, helping data publishers to improve the integrity of their
          published data, as well as to encourage the publication of new data.
          Feedback allows data consumers to have a voice describing usage
          experiences (e.g. applications using data), preferences and needs.
          When possible, feedback should also be publicly available for other
          data consumers to examine. Making feedback publicly available allows
          users to become aware of other data consumers, supports a
          collaborative environment, and allows user community experiences,
          concerns or questions are currently being addressed.</p>
        <p>From a user interface perspective there are different ways to gather
          feedback from data consumers, including site registration, contact
          forms, quality ratings selection, surveys and comment boxes for
          blogging. From a machine perspective the data publisher can also
          record metrics on data usage or information about specific
          applications consumers are currently relying upon. Feedback such as
          this establishes a line of communication channel between data
          publishers and data consumers. In order to quantify and analyze usage
          feedback, it should be recorded in a machine-readable format. Blogs
          and other publicly available feedback should be displayed in a
          human-readable form through the user interface. </p>
        <p> This section provides some BP to be followed by data publishers in
          order to enable data consumers to provide feedback about the consumed
          data. This feedback can be for humans or machines. </p>

          <p class="practicedesc"> Data publishers <em class="rfc2119">should</em>

          <section class="axioms">
            <p class="subhead">Why</p>
            <p>Providing feedback contributes to improving the quality of
              published data, may encourage publication of new data, helps data
              publishers understand data consumers needs better and, when
              feedback is made publicly available, enhances the consumers'
              collaborative experience.</p>

            <p class="subhead">Intended Outcome</p>
            <p>It should be possible for data consumers to provide feedback and
              rate data in both human and machine-readable formats. The feedback
              should be Web accessible and it should provide a URL reference to
              the corresponding dataset.</p>
          </section>
          <section class="how">
            <p class="subhead">Possible Approach to Implementation</p>
            <p>Provide data consumers with one or more feedback mechanisms
              including, but not limited to: a registration form, contact form,
              point and click data quality rating buttons, or a comment box for
              blogging.</p>
            <p>Collect feedback in machine-readable formats to represent the
              feedback and use a vocabulary to capture the semantics of the
              feedback information.
              <!-- The definition of a Data Usage Vocabulary is
              included in the activity of the DWBP group in order to support in              the implementation of this best practice. --></p>

          <section class="test">
            <p class="subhead">How to Test</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Demonstrate how feedback can be collected from data consumers.
              </li>
              <li>Verify that the feedback is persistently stored. If the
                feedback is made publicly available verify that a URL links back
                to the published data being referenced.</li>
              <li>Check that the feedback format conforms to a known
                machine-readable format specification in current use among
                anticipated data users. </li>
