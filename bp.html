      <p>This document provides best practices related to the
        publication and usage of data on the Web designed to help support a
        self-sustaining ecosystem. Data should be discoverable and
        understandable by humans and machines. Where data is used in some way,
        whether by the originator of the data or by an external party, such
        usage should also be discoverable and the efforts of the data publisher
        recognized. In short, following these best practices will facilitate
        interaction between publishers and consumers.</p>

    <section id="sotd">
      <p>This early version of the document shows its expected scope and future
        direction. A template is used that shows the what, why and how of each
        best practice. Comments are sought on the usefulness of this approach
        and the expected scope of the final document.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="intro" class="informative">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Data on the Web Best Practices have been developed to encourage and
        enable the continued expansion of the Web as a medium for the exchange
        of data. The growth of open data by governments across the world
        [[OKFN-INDEX]], the increasing publication of research data encouraged
        by organizations like the Research Data Alliance [[RDA]], the harvesting
        and analysis of social media, crowd-sourcing of information, the
        provision of important cultural heritage collections such as at the
        Biblioth√®que nationale de France [[BNF]] and the sustained growth in the
        Linked Open Data Cloud [[LODC]], provide some examples of this
        phenomenon.</p>
      <p>In broad terms, data publishers aim to share data either openly or
        through a paywall/firewall. Data consumers (who may also be producers
        themselves) want to be able to find and use data, especially if it is
        accurate, regularly updated and guaranteed to be available at all times.
        This creates a fundamental need for a common understanding between data
        publishers and data consumers. Without this agreement, data publishers'
        efforts may be incompatible with data consumers' desires.</p>
      <p>Publishing data on the Web creates new challenges, such as how to
        represent, describe and make data available in a way that it will be
        easy to find and to understand. In this context, it becomes crucial to
        provide guidance to publishers that will improve consistency in the way
        data is managed, thus promoting the reuse of data and also to foster
        trust in the data among developers, whatever technology they choose to
        use, increasing the potential for genuine innovation.</p>
      <p>This document sets out a series of best practices that will help
        publishers and consumers face the new challenges and opportunities posed
        by data on the Web. </p>
      <p>Best practices cover different aspects related to data publishing and
        consumption, like data formats, data access, data identification and
        metadata. In order to delimit the scope and elicit the required features
        for Data on the Web Best Practices, the <abbr title="Data on the Web Best Practices">DWBP</abbr>
        working group compiled a set of use cases [[UCR]] that represent
        scenarios of how data is commonly published on the Web and how it is
        used. The set of requirements derived from these use cases were used to
        guide the development of the best practice.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="audience" class="informative">
      <h2>Audience</h2>
      <p>This document provides best practices to those who publish data on the
        Web. The best practices are designed to meet the needs of information
        management staff, developers, and wider groups such as scientists
        interested in sharing and reusing research data on the Web. Every
        attempt has been made to make the document as readable and usable as
        possible while still retaining the accuracy and clarity needed in a
        technical specification. </p>
      <p>Readers of this document are expected to be familiar with some
        fundamental concepts of the architecture of the Web [[!WEBARCH]], such
        as resources and URIs, as well as a number of data formats. The
        normative element of each best practice is the <em>intended outcome</em>.
        Possible implementations are suggested and, where appropriate, these
        recommend the use of a particular technology such as <abbr title="Comma Separataed Variables">CSV</abbr>,
        JSON or RDF. A basic knowledge of vocabularies and data models would be
        helpful to better understand some aspects of this document. </p>
      <p>This document is not targeted solely at data publishers; others
        interested on using the published data are encouraged to read it.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="scope" class="informative">
      <h2>Scope</h2>
      <p>This document is concerned solely with best practices that:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>are specifically relevant to data published on the Web;</li>
        <li>encourage publication or reuse of data on the Web;</li>
        <li>can be tested by machines, humans or a combination of the two.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>As noted above, whether a best practice has or has not been followed
        should be judged against the <em>intended outcome</em>, not the
        specific implementation which is offered as guidance. A best practice is
        always subject to improvement as we learn and evolve the Web together.</p>

        <h2>Data on the Web Challenges</h2>
        <p>The openness and flexibility of the Web creates new challenges for
          data publishers and data consumers. In contrast to conventional
          databases, for example, where there's is a single data model to
          represent the data and a database management system (DBMS) to control
          data access, data on the Web allows for the existence of multiple ways
          to represent and to access data. Furthermore, publishers and consumers
          may be unknown to each other and be part of entirely disparate
          communities with different norms and in-built assumptions so that it
          becomes essential to provide information about data structure,
          quality, provenance and any terms of use. The following list
          summarizes some of the main challenges faced when publishing or
          consuming data on the Web. These challenges were identified from the <abbr

            title="Data on the Web Best Practices">DWBP</abbr> Use Cases and
          Requirements [[UCR]] and are described by one or more questions.</p>

        </dl>
        <p> Each one of these challenges originated one or more requirements as
          documented in <a href="http://w3c.github.io/dwbp/usecasesv1.html#R-UniqueIdentifier">the
            use-cases document</a>. The development of Data on the Web Best
          practices were guided by these requirements, in such a way that each
          best practice should have at least one of these requirements as an
          evidence of its relevance.</p>

      <section id="lifecycle">
        <h2>Data on the Web Lifecycle</h2>
        <p>Literature presents a lot of proposals for data lifecycles ranging
          from multimedia data to digital libraries. Knud M√∂ller [[MOLLER]]
          presents a survey of lifecycle models for data-centric domains as well
          as an Abstract Data Lifecycle Model (<abbr title="Abstract Data Lifecycle Model">ADLM</abbr>)
          comprising a set of phases, features and roles that can be used to
          classify and compare existing lifecycle models. <abbr title="Abstract Data Lifecycle Model">ADLM</abbr>
          also provides the basis to construct new lifecycle models for
          data-centric domains. Following this pattern, a generic lifecycle
          model for data-centric domains comprises the following main phases: <em>Ontology
            development</em>, <em>Planning</em>, <em>Creation</em>, <em>Archiving</em>,
          <em>Refinement</em>, <em>Publication</em>, <em>Access</em>, <em>External
            use</em>, <em>Feedback</em> and <em>Termination</em>.</p>
        <p>The Data on the Web lifecycle is an instance of an <abbr title="Abstract Data Lifecycle Model">ADLM</abbr>.
          In what follows, the <abbr title="Abstract Data Lifecycle Model">ADLM</abbr>
          phases are revisited and defined according to the data on the Web
          context. It is important to note that the ontology development phase
          is not included, since it is considered an independent phase that can
          take place <i>a priori</i>. The termination phase is also out of
          scope since it is not possible to make sure that a piece of data was
          completely removed from the Web. </p>
        <ul>
          <li><em>Data Planning</em>: this phase concerns the moment when the
            intent to publish data on the Web takes a concrete form. It also
            comprises the selection of data to be published.</li>
          <li><em>Data Creation</em>: defines the moment when new data is
            created, i.e, it means that the data did not previously exist on the
            Web. It may comprise the extraction of data from existing data
            sources and its transformation to a proper format or structure for
            publishing on the Web. </li>
          <li><em>Data Publication</em>: this phase concerns the moment when
            data is made accessible on the Web.</li>
          <li><em>Access</em>: denotes the moment in the lifecycle when users
            gain access to the data available on the Web.</li>
          <li><em>External use</em>: implies that data was used to perform some
            further actions like the creation of visualizations or data
            analysis.</li>
          <li><em>Feedback</em>: this phase concerns the moment when users
            comment on the data or metadata they have previously accessed and
            used.</li>
          <li><em>Refinement</em>: this phase covers all kinds of activities
            that make additions or changes to data that already exist on the
            Web. It also concerns the management of data versioning. </li>
          <li><em>Data Archiving</em>: defines the moment when data no longer
            needs to be available on the Web. </li>
        </ul>
        <figure id="centerImg"> <img src="images/lifecyclesvg.svg" alt="The diagram shows the different phases of the Data on the Web lifecycle"

            width="450"><figcaption>The different phases of the Data on the Web
            lifecycle</figcaption></figure>
        <p>As proposed in [[MOLLER]], the data on the Web lifecycle model is an
          evolving one, since there is no restriction for data to pass through
          all phases of the lifecycle before the start of a new iteration,
          neither a specific point of the lifecyle to begin with.</p>
        <p>In the data on the Web context, two main roles may be played by
          actors in the lifecycle: data publisher and data consumer. The data
          publisher role may be played by several actors who are responsible for
          performing actions like data and metadata creation, and data
          publication and archiving. The data consumer are these actors who
          receive and consume the data. Of course consumers may well also be
          publishers.</p>

      <h2>The Best Practices</h2>
      <p>This section contains the best practices to be used by data publishers
        in order to help them and data consumers to overcome the different
        challenges faced during the data on the Web lifecycle. One or more best
        practices were proposed for each one of the previously described
        challenges. Each BP is related to one or more requirements from the <a

          href="http://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp-ucr/">Data on the Web Best Practices
          Use Cases &amp; Requirements document.</a></p>
      <section id="metadata">
        <h3>Metadata</h3>
        <p>Metadata is data about data. It provides additional information that
          helps consumers better understand the meaning of data, its structure,
          and to clarify other issues, such as rights and license terms, the
          organization that generated the data, data quality, data access
          methods, the update schedule of datasets, etc.</p>
        <p>Metadata can be used to help tasks such as dataset discovery and
          reuse, and can be assigned considering different levels of granularity
          from a single property of a resource to a whole dataset, or all
          datasets from a specific organization.</p>
        <p>Metadata can be of different types. These types can be classified in
          different taxonomies, with different grouping criteria. For example, a
          specific taxonomy could define three metadata types according to
          descriptive, structural and administrative features. Descriptive
          metadata serves to identify a dataset, structural metadata serves to
          understand the format(s) in which the dataset is distributed and
          administrative metadata serves to provide information about the
          version, update schedule etc. A different taxonomy could define
          metadata types with a scheme according to tasks where metadata are
          used, for example, discovery and reuse.</p>
        <p>This document specifies the intended outcomes for each best practice
          and then gives some guidance on possible implementation methods. In
          terms of metadata, the particular implementation method will depend on
          the format of the dataset distribution, for example, metadata
          describing a CSV file <em class="rfc2119">should</em> be provided in
          a different way than for an RDF dataset. However, the <em>intention</em>
          is the same irrespective of format.</p>

            <p class="subhead">Why</p>

              <li>Use DCAT [[VOCAB-DCAT]] to <strong>describe the dataset as a
                  whole</strong> and the administrative environment in which it
                was created. This vocabulary reuses much of the Dublin Core
                Metadata set [[DC-TERMS]] that provides common terms such as
                title, date, description, creator etc.</li>
              <li>For RDF datasets, use Vocabulary of Interlinked Datasets (VoID)
                  [[VOID]] to <strong>describe the dataset as a
                  whole</strong> and the administrative environment in which it
                was created. As DCAT, VoID uses Dublin Core Metadata set
                to describe the dataset. It can also describe patterns of the URIs used
                to access the resources and how multiple datasets 
                are related and can be used together.</li>
              <li>Use an appropriate metadata schema to describe the <strong>structure
                  of the dataset</strong> as, for example, the Metadata Vocabulary for Tabular Data for <abbr title="Comma Separated Variables">CSV</abbr>
                    files [[TABULAR-METADATA]].</li>
              <li>Use the <code>dcterms:license</code> or <code>dcterms:rights</code>
                to link a dataset to license and/or rights information.</li>
            </ul>

              typically act on instructions from, and report back to, humans.
              That is, it will often be a human that reads and makes a variety
              of assessments based on the metadata.</p>

          <section class="axioms">
            <p class="subhead">Why</p>
            <p>The provision of metadata is fundamental to data on the Web. It
              is the shop window, the user-manual and the conditions of use. It
              is possible to provide this information an an infinite number of
              ways: <i>maker</i>, <i>author</i>, <i>originator</i>, <i>person
                responsible</i> and <i>source</i> are among the many near
              synonyms for <i>creator</i>. And of course those examples are all
              just in a single language. The task of finding and processing
              relevant data among the vast amounts available on the Web, for
              people and the computer systems they use, is made substantially
              more achievable if different publishers use the same terms as each
              other, or rather, use <em>common identifers</em> for the terms
              used, however those terms are presented to humans. Only in this
              way can the same tools and methods be used for multiple tasks.</p>

            <p>Metadata is best provided using RDF vocabularies. Each term in an
              RDF vocabulary has its own HTTP URI to which labels and
              descriptions in multiple languages can be attached. If labels are
              not provided in your language, you can add them. If your context
              demands that a term be specialized, you can create a sub class or
              sub property but retain the benefits of the original vocabulariy's
              semantics.</p>

          <section class="axioms">
            <p class="subhead">Why</p>
            <p>The use of standardized vocabularies is a crucial step towards
              interoperability but there is almost always a choice of
              vocabularies that can be used to achieve a given task. In addition
              there are often multiple ways of using a single vocabulary. For
              example, the value of <code>dcterms:spatial</code> should be a
              URI but those provided by <a href="http://www.geonames.org/">geonames</a>,
              <a href="http://dbpedia.org/">dbpedia</a> and <a href="http://www.wikidata.org/">wikidata</a>
              are just three possible sources of such URIs. Ensuring that the
              value of a property is always drawn from a controlled list of
              allowed values, such as a code list, helps interoperability but it
              may be that some of the same values occur in multiple lists. While
              it may be obvious to at least some potential users which
              vocabularies have been used and how they have been used,
              documenting this can often make the policies used more explicit,
              thereby reducing surprises and increasing confidence among users.</p>
            <p>Documentation is particularly important where vocabularies have

        <h3>Data Vocabularies</h3>
        <p>Datasets often resort to a range of vocabularies in the data they
          contain: data values are entered or captured in a controlled way,
          i.e., for certain positions in a data graph (or column in a
          relationship table), the value used should come with a limited set of
          pre-existing resources: for example object types, roles of a person,
          countries in a geographic area, or possible subjects for books. Such
          vocabularies aim to represent a set of terms and the relationship
          among them, in order to ensure a level of control, standardization and
          interoperability in the data. They can also provide a way to easily
          create richer data. Say, a dataset contain one reference in a data
          statement to a concept description in several languages. This single
          statement allows applications to localize their display of their
          search depending on the language of the user. The vocabularies can
          also have different forms (e.g. thesaurus, taxonomy, semantic network)
          and be represented in different formats (e.g. RDF, OWL, JSON, CSV).
          This section presents best practices for data vocabularies accessible
          as URI sets on the Web. </p>
        <p> According to <a href="http://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/ontology">
            W3C </a>, Vocabularies define the concepts and relationships (also
          referred to as ‚Äúterms‚Äù) used to describe and represent an area of
          concern. Vocabularies are used to classify the terms that can be used
          in a particular application, characterize possible relationships, and
          define possible constraints on using those terms. In practice,
          vocabularies can be very complex (with several thousands of terms) or
          very simple (describing one or two concepts only). There is no clear
          division between what is referred to as ‚Äúvocabularies‚Äù and
          ‚Äúontologies‚Äù. The trend is to use the word ‚Äúontology‚Äù for more
          complex, and possibly quite formal collection of terms, whereas
          ‚Äúvocabulary‚Äù is used when such strict formalism is not necessarily
          used or only in a very loose sense. Vocabularies are the basic
          building blocks for inference techniques on the Semantic Web. W3C
          offers different ways for creating Vocabularies on the Web in a
          standard format, such as: </p>
        <ol>
          <li> <a href="http://www.w3.org/standards/techs/rdf#w3c_all"> RDF and
              RDF Schemas </a>: The Resource Description Framework (RDF) is a
            general-purpose language for representing information in the Web; </li>
          <li> <a href="http://www.w3.org/standards/techs/skos#w3c_all"> SKOS </a>:
            Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS) is a common data model
            for sharing and linking knowledge organization systems via the Web;
          </li>
          <li> <a href="http://www.w3.org/standards/techs/owl#w3c_all"> OWL </a>:
            The Web Ontology Language (OWL) is a semantic markup language for
            publishing and sharing ontologies on the World Wide Web </li>
          <li> <a href="http://www.w3.org/standards/techs/rif#w3c_all"> RIF </a>:
            W3C Rule Interchange Format (RIF) for writing declarative rules and
            production rules on the Web. </li>
        </ol>
        <p> Vocabularies can be of two different types: </p>
        <ol>
          <li> Light-weight: annotation-oriented (used for information search),
            describing the concepts and their relationships. Here is recommended
            the use of SKOS or RDF and RDF Schema.</li>
          <li> Heavy-weight: the body of knowledge that describes a given
            domain, describing the concepts and relationships between them from
            both perspectives: hierarchy and aggregation/composition. In
            addition, such heavy-weight descriptions provide the axiomatization
            of semantics constraints between those concepts and relations. Here
            is recommended the use of OWL and RIF.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>How to create vocabularies?</h4>
        <p> Three different approaches may be adopted to create vocabularies: </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Top-layer: the whole building process compliant with the
            conventional software development process </li>
          <li>Middle-layer: Generic constraints and guidelines which specify
            major steps </li>
          <li>Bottom-layer: The most fine-grain guidelines such as those for
            class identification process, design of URIs, ODP, Anti-Patterns
            etc.</li>
        </ol>
        Some of the Best Practices for the creation of vocabularies are
        presented in the following.

        <h3>How to choose vocabularies?</h3>
        <p> It is very important to know how to choose the vocabulary to be

        <h3> How to reuse vocabularies ? </h3>
        <p> In order to provide semantic interoperability between applications,
          it is important to reuse well-know vocabularies wherever possible.

        <h3>Data Licenses</h3>
        <p>License is a piece of information very useful to be attached to data on the Web.  As defined by [[DC-TERMS]], a license is a legal document giving official permission to do something with the data to which it is associated.  According to the type of license adopted by the publisher, there might be more or less restrictions on sharing and reusing data. In the context of the Web of Data, the license of a dataset can be specified within the data, or outside of it, in a separate document linking the data. However, in line with the Linked Data principles, licenses for such datasets <em class="rfc2119">should</em> be specified in RDF, for instance through the Dublin Core vocabulary [[DC-TERMS]]

        <h3>Data Provenance</h3>
        <p>Provenance originates from the French term provenir (to come from),
          which is used to describe the curation process of artwork as art is
          passed from owner to owner. Data provenance, in a similar way, is
          metadata, that allows data providers to pass details about the data
          history to data users. Provenance becomes particularly important when
          data is shared between collaborators who might not have direct contact
          with one another either due to proximity or because the published data
          outlives the lifespan of the data provider projects or organizations.</p>
        <p>The web brings together business, engineering, and scientific
          communities creating collaborative opportunities that were previously
          unimaginable. The challenge is publishing data on the web is providing
          an appropriate level of detail about its origin. The data publishers
          may not necessarily be the data provider and so collecting and
          conveying this corresponding metadata is particularly important.
          Without provenance, data users have no inherent way to trust the
          integrity and credibility of the data being shared. Data publishers in
          turn need to be aware of the needs of prospective data user
          communities to know how much provenance detail is appropriate. </p>
        <p>Fortunately, the W3C community offers the Provenance Ontology
          [[PROV-O]] so that data publishers can formally describe data
          provenance and methodologies so that data user can query and use
          provenance. </p>

        <h3>Data Quality</h3>
        <p>Data quality is commonly defined as ‚Äúfitness for use‚Äù for a specific
          application or use case. It can affect the potentiality of the
          application that use data, as a consequence, its inclusion in the data
          publishing and consumption pipelines is of primary importance. </p>
        <p>Usually, the assessment of quality involves different kinds of
          quality dimensions, each representing groups of characteristics that
          are relevant to publishers and consumers. Measures and metrics are
          defined to assess the quality for each dimension. They are heuristics
          designed to fit specific assessment situations and rely on quality
          indicators, namely, pieces of data content, pieces of data
          meta-information, human ratings, which give indication about the
          suitability of data for some intended use. </p>
        <p>Dimensions and metrics to adopt might largely depend on the specific
          application scenario, or even on the data domain. A systematic review
          of dimensions, metrics adopted in the context of Open Linked data can
          be found in the recent literature (e.g., see [[ZAVERI]]). </p>

        <h3>Data Access</h3>
        <p>Providing an easy access to data on the Web enable both humans and
          machines to take advantage of the benefits of sharing data on top of
          the Web infrastructure. By default, the web offers access using
          Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) methods. This provides access to
          data at an atomic transaction level. However, when data is distributed
          across multiple files or requires more sophisticated retrieval methods
          different approaches can be adopted to enable data access, including:
          bulk download and APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). </p>
        <p>One approach is packaging data in bulk using non-proprietary file
          formats(for example zip files or tar files). Using this approach, bulk
          data is generally pre-processed server side where multiple files or
          directory trees of files are provided as one downloadable file. When
          bulk data is being retrieved from non-file system solutions, depending
          on the data user communities, data publisher should offer APIs to
          support a series of retrieval operations representing a single
          transaction.</p>
        <p>For data that is streaming to the web in ‚Äúreal time‚Äù or ‚Äúnear real
          time‚Äù, data publishers must publish data or use APIs to enable
          immediate access to data, allowing access to critical time sensitive
          data, such as emergency information, weather forecasting data, or
          published system metrics. For all data on the web, APIs should be
          available to allow third parties to automatically search and retrieve
          data published on the Web. </p>
        <p> This section provides some BP to be followed by data publishers in
          order to enable easy data access for data consumers.</p>

          it. Web pages can be preserved following the same strategies,
          considering a web site as a static data set that is self-contained and
          can be all snap-shoted and preserved at a fixed time. When it comes to
          Web data some new elements have to be taken into account, namely:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The persistent identifiers (IRI) used across the web are related
            to live data that can change</li>
          <li>The meaning of a resource is contextualized by the other resources
            it is linked to</li>
          <li>Documents fetched in HTML, RDF of JSON, for instance, are only one
            of the many possible serialisation of the data they represent</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The preservation of Web data should generaly focus on the
          preservation of the description of entities.</p>

            <p>
              Web data is about the description of resources identified with
                a IRI.It is to be expected that queries made by data consumers will
                resolve around finding a preserved description about a
                particular resource.
            </p>
            <p>Web data is essentially about the description of entities
              identified by a unique, Web-based, identifier (a URI). Once the
              data is dumped and sent to a institute specialised in digital
              preservation the link with the Web is broken (de-referencing) but
              the role of the URI as a unique identifier still remains. In order
              to increase the usability of preserved dataset dumps it is
              relevant to maintain a list of these identifiers.</p>

            <p>A chunk of Web data is by definition dependent on the rest of

              Ideally, the preservation of a particular dataset would

              Linking preserved datasets with resolving URI inform the data

            </p>
            <p>During its live cycle a Web data dataset may undergo several
              modifications. Although IRIs assigned to things are not expected
              to change, the description of these resource will evolve over
              time. There are also some new IRIs that will be put into use, some
              other that will become deprecated, and some that will get deleted.
              Along to this evolution several snapshots could be made available
              for preservation. An example of this is DBpedia which has undergo
              several releases since its first publication and always use the
              same IRI for its resources. Every resource is de-referenced to the
              most up to date description available for it along with a link to
              preserved descriptions using the protocol Memento (see <a href="http://mementoweb.org/depot/native/dbpedia/">Memento

            <p>There is a variety of HTTP status code that could be put into use
              to relate the IRI with its preserved description. In particular,
              200, 404, 410, 303 and 209 can be used for different scenarios:</p>
            <ul>

              <li>410 =&gt; dead again but this time it's a controlled process</li>
              <li>303 =&gt; the description of this URI is no longer served here

        <h3>Feedback</h3>
        <p>Publishing data on the Web enables data sharing on a large scale,
          providing data access to a wide range of audiences with different
          levels of expertise. Data publishers want to ensure that the data
          published is meeting the data consumer needs and user feedback is
          crucial. Feedback has benefits for both data publishers and data
          consumers, helping data publishers to improve the integrity of their
          published data, as well as to encourage the publication of new data.
          Feedback allows data consumers to have a voice describing usage
          experiences (e.g. applications using data), preferences and needs.
          When possible, feedback should also be publicly available for other
          data consumers to examine. Making feedback publicly available, allows
          users to become aware of other data consumers, supports a
          collaborative environment, and allows user community experiences,
          concerns or questions are currently being addressed.</p>
        <p> From a user interface perspective there are different ways to gather
          feedback from data consumers, including site registration, contact
          forms, quality ratings selection, surveys and comment boxes for
          blogging. From a machine perspective the data publisher can also
          record metrics on data usage or information about specific
          applications consumers are currently relying upon. Feedback such as
          this establishes a line of communication channel between data
          publishers and data consumers. In order to quantify and analyze usage
          feedback, it should be recorded in a machine-readable format.Blogs and
          other publicly available feedback should be displayed in a
          human-readable form through the user interface. </p>
        <p> This section provides some BP to be followed by data publishers in
          order to enable data consumers to provide feedback about the consumed
          data. This feedback can be for humans or machines. </p>
