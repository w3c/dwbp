      <p>This document provides best practices related to the
        publication and usage of data on the Web designed to help support a
        self-sustaining ecosystem. Data should be discoverable and
        understandable by humans and machines. Where data is used in some way,
        whether by the originator of the data or by an external party, such
        usage should also be discoverable and the efforts of the data publisher
        recognized. In short, following these best practices will facilitate
        interaction between publishers and consumers.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="sotd">
      <p>This version of the document shows its expected scope and future
        direction. A template is used to show the "what", "why" and "how" of
        each best practice. Comments are sought on the usefulness of this
        approach and the expected scope of the final document.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="intro" class="informative">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>The best practices described below have been developed to encourage and
        enable the continued expansion of the Web as a medium for the exchange
        of data. The growth of open data by governments across the world
        [[OKFN-INDEX]], the increasing publication of research data encouraged
        by organizations like the Research Data Alliance [[RDA]], the harvesting
        and analysis of social media, crowd-sourcing of information, the
        provision of important cultural heritage collections such as at the
        BibliothÃ¨que nationale de France [[BNF]] and the sustained growth in the
        Linked Open Data Cloud [[LODC]], provide some examples of this
        phenomenon.</p>
      <p>In broad terms, data publishers aim to share data either openly or with
        controlled access. Data consumers (who may also be producers themselves)
        want to be able to find and use data, especially if it is accurate,
        regularly updated and guaranteed to be available at all times. This
        creates a fundamental need for a common understanding between data
        publishers and data consumers. Without this agreement, data publishers'
        efforts may be incompatible with data consumers' desires.</p>
      <p>The openness and flexibility of the Web creates new challenges for data
        publishers and data consumers, such as how to
        represent, describe and make data available in a way that it will be
        easy to find and to understand. In contrast to conventional databases,
        for example, where there is a single data model to represent the data
        and a database management system (DBMS) to control data access, data on
        the Web allows for the existence of multiple ways to represent and to
        access data. For more details about the challenges see the section <a href="#challenges">Data on the Web Challenges</a>.</p>
      <p>In this context, it becomes crucial to
        provide guidance to publishers that will improve consistency in the way
        data is managed, thus promoting the reuse of data and also to foster
        trust in the data among developers, whatever technology they choose to
        use, increasing the potential for genuine innovation.</p>
      <p>A general best practice to publish Data on the Web is to use standards. Different types of organizations specify standards that are specific to the publishing of datasets related to particular domains/applications, involving communities of users interested in that data. These standards define a common way of communicating information among the users of these communities. For example, publishing of timetables have two standards, the General Transit Feed Specification [[GTFS]] and the Service Interface for Real Time Information [[SIRI]], that specify, in a mixed way, standardize terms, standardized data formats and standardized data access. As was said before, the Best Practices proposed in this document serve a general purpose of publishing and using Data on the Web. These Best Practices are domain/application independent. They could be extended or complemented by other best practices documents or standards that cover the publishing of datasets in a more restricted universe.</p>
      <p>Taking that into account, this document sets out a series of best practices that will help publishers and consumers face the new challenges and opportunities posed by data on the Web. They intend to serve a general purpose of publishing and using Data on the Web, but they may be specialized according to specific domains, such as Spatial Data on the Web Best Practices [[SDW]].</p>
      <p>Best practices cover different aspects related to data publishing and
        consumption, like data formats, data access, data identifiers and
        metadata. In order to delimit the scope and elicit the required features
        for Data on the Web Best Practices, the <abbr title="Data on the Web Best Practices">DWBP</abbr>
        working group compiled a set of use cases [[UCR]] that represent
        scenarios of how data is commonly published on the Web and how it is
        used. The set of requirements derived from these use cases were used to
        guide the development of the best practices.</p>
      <p>The Best Practices proposed in this document are intended to serve a
        more general purpose than the practices suggested in Best Practices for
        Publishing Linked Data [[LD-BP]] since it is domain-independent and
        whilst it recommends the use of Linked Data, it also promotes best
        practices for data on the Web in formats such as CSV [[RFC4180]] and
        JSON [[RFC4627]]. The Best Practices related to the use of vocabularies
        incorporate practices that stem from Best Practices for Publishing
        Linked Data where appropriate.</p>
      <p>In order to encourage data publishers to adopt the DWBP, benefits were set: comprehension; processability; discoverability; reuse; trust; linkability; access; and interoperability. They are described and related to the Best Practices in the section <a href="#BP_Benefits">Best Practices Benefits</a>.</p>

    <section id="audience" class="informative">
      <h2>Audience</h2>
      <p>This document provides best practices to those who publish data on the
        Web. The best practices are designed to meet the needs of information
        management staff, developers, and wider groups such as scientists
        interested in sharing and reusing research data on the Web. While data
        publishers are our primary audience, we encourage all those engaged in
        related activities to become familiar with it. Every attempt has been
        made to make the document as readable and usable as possible while still
        retaining the accuracy and clarity needed in a technical specification.</p>
      <p>Readers of this document are expected to be familiar with some
        fundamental concepts of the architecture of the Web [[WEBARCH]], such as
        resources and URIs, as well as a number of data formats. The normative
        element of each best practice is the <em>intended outcome</em>.
        Possible implementations are suggested and, where appropriate, these
        recommend the use of a particular technology such as CSV, JSON and RDF.
        A basic knowledge of vocabularies and data models would be helpful to
        better understand some aspects of this document. </p>
    </section>
    <section id="scope" class="informative">
      <h2>Scope</h2>
      <p>This document is concerned solely with best practices that:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>are specifically relevant to data published on the Web;</li>
        <li>encourage publication or reuse of data on the Web;</li>
        <li>can be tested by machines, humans or a combination of the two.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>As noted above, whether a best practice has or has not been followed
        should be judged against the <em>intended outcome</em>, not the <em>possible
          approach to implementation</em> which is offered as guidance. A best
        practice is always subject to improvement as we learn and evolve the Web
        together.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="context" class="informative">
      <h2>Context</h2>
      <p> In general, the Best Practices proposed for publication and usage of
        Data on the Web refer to <a href="#dataset">datasets</a> and <a href="#distribution">
          distributions</a>. Data is published in different distributions, which
        is a specific physical form of a dataset. By data, "we mean known facts
        that can be recorded and that have implicit meaning" [[Navathe]]. These
        distributions facilitate the sharing of data on a large scale, which
        allows datasets to be used for several groups of <a href="#data_consumer">
          data consumers </a>, without regard to purpose, audience, interest,
        or license. Given this heterogeneity and the fact that data publishers
        and data consumers may be unknown to each other, it is necessary to
        provide some information about the datasets which may also contribute to
        trustworthiness and reuse, such as: structural metadata, descriptive
        metadata, access information, data quality information, provenance
        information, license information and usage information. </p>
      <p> Other important aspect of publishing and sharing data on the Web
        concerns the architectural bases of the Web as discussed in [[WEBARCH]].
        The <abbr title="Data on the Web Best Practices">DWBP</abbr> document
        is mainly interested on the Identification principle that says that URIs
        should be used to identify resources. In our context, a resource may be
        a whole dataset or a specific item of given dataset. All resources
        should be published with stable URIs, so that they can be referenced and
        make links, via URI, between two or more resources.</p>
      <p>The following diagram illustrates the dataset composition (data values
        and metadata) together with other components related to the dataset
        publication and usage. Data values correspond to the data itself and may
        be available in one or more distributions, which should be defined by
        the publisher considering data consumer's expectations. The Metadata
        component corresponds to the additional information that describes the
        dataset and dataset distributions, helping the manipulation and the
        reuse of the data. In order to allow an easy access to the dataset and
        its corresponding distributions, multiple Dataset Access mechanisms
        should be available. Finally, to promote the interoperability among
        datasets it is important to adopt Data Vocabularies and Standards. </p>

      <h2>The Best Practices</h2>
      <p>This section contains the best practices to be used by data publishers in order to help them and data consumers to overcome the different challenges faced when publishing and consuming data on the Web. One or more best practices were proposed for each one of the challenges, which are described in the section <a href="#challenges">Data on the Web Challenges</a>.</p>
      <p>Each BP is related to one or more requirements from the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp-ucr/">Data on the Web Best Practices Use Cases &amp; Requirements document</a> document and the development of Data on the Web Best Practices was guided by these requirements, in such a way that each best practice should have at least one of these requirements as an evidence of its relevance.</p>
      <section id="basicExample">
        <h3>Example</h3>
        <p> This example serves as a basis for elaboration that will be
          described in subsequent sections. It helps to illustrate how best
          practices may be applied. </p>
        <aside class="example">
          <p> John works for the Transport Agency of MyCity and he is in charge
            of the publication of data on the Web about bus timetables as well
            as real time data about the traffic of the city. John decides to
            create two datasets: one for the bus timetables and other one for
            the real time traffic data. </p>
          <p> Some requirements that should be addressed:</p>
          <ul>
            <li> The dataset for bus timetables must be available in two
              languages: English and Portuguese; </li>
            <li> Both datasets must be available in CSV and JSON-LD formats; </li>
          </ul>

        When necessary RDF examples will be used to show the result of the
        application of some best practices. RDF examples in this document are
        written in Turtle syntax [[TURTLE]] and [[JSON-LD]].

          syntax. </p>

      <section id="metadata">
        <h3>Metadata</h3>
        <p>The Web is an open information space, where the absence of a specific
          context, such a company's internal information system, means that the
          provision of metadata is a fundamental requirement. Data will not be
          discoverable or reusable by anyone other than the publisher if
          insufficient metadata is provided. Metadata provides additional
          information that helps data consumers better understand the meaning of
          data, its structure, and to clarify other issues, such as rights and
          license terms, the organization that generated the data, data quality,
          data access methods and the update schedule of datasets. <br>
        </p>
        Metadata can be used to help tasks such as dataset discovery and reuse,
        and can be assigned considering different levels of granularity from a
        single property of a resource to a whole dataset, or all datasets from a
        specific organization. <br>
        <p>Metadata can be of different types. These types can be classified in
          different taxonomies, with different grouping criteria. For example, a
          specific taxonomy could define three metadata types according to
          descriptive, structural and administrative features. Descriptive
          metadata serves to identify a dataset, structural metadata serves to
          understand the structure in which the dataset is distributed and
          administrative metadata serves to provide information about the
          version, update schedule etc. A different taxonomy could define
          metadata types with a scheme according to tasks where metadata are
          used, for example, discovery and reuse. </p>

          <section class="axioms">
            <p class="subhead">Why</p>
            <p>Providing metadata is a fundamental requirement when publishing
              data on the Web because data publishers and data consumers may be
              unknown to each other. Then, it is essential to provide information
              that helps human users and computer applications to understand the
              data as well as other important aspects that describes a dataset
              or a distribution.</p>
          </section>
          <section class="outcome">
            <p class="subhead">Intended Outcome</p>
            <p>The metadata should be coherent with the described resource (i.e. dataset, distribution or the data itself) and it must be possible for humans to interpret the metadata, which makes it human-readable metadata. It also should be possible for computer applications, notably user agents, to process the metadata, which makes it machine-readable metadata.</p>

            <p class="subhead">Possible Approach to Implementation</p>
            Possible approaches to provide <em>human readable metadata:</em><br>
            <ul>
              <li>to provide metadata as part of an HTML Web page</li>
              <li>to provide metadata as a separate text file</li>
            </ul>
            Possible approaches to provide <em>machine readable metadata:</em><br>
            <ul>
              <li> machine readable metadata may be provided in a serialization
                format such as Turtle and JSON, or it can be embedded in the
                HTML page using [[HTML-RDFA]] or [[JSON-LD]]. If multiple
                formats are published separately, they should be served from the
                same URL using content negotiation. Maintenance of multiple
                formats is best achieved by generating each available format on
                the fly based on a single source of the metadata.</li>
              <li> when defining machine readable metadata, reusing existing
                standard terms and popular vocabularies are strongly
                recommended. For example, Dublin Core Metadata (DCMI) terms
                [[DC-TERMS]] and Data Catalog Vocabulary [[VOCAB-DCAT]] should
                be used to provide descriptive metadata.</li>

        <h3>Data Provenance</h3>
        <p> <a href="#data_provenance">Data provenance</a> becomes particularly
          important when data is shared between collaborators who might not have
          direct contact with one another either due to proximity or because the
          published data outlives the lifespan of the data provider projects or
          organizations.</p>
        <p>The Web brings together business, engineering, and scientific
          communities creating collaborative opportunities that were previously
          unimaginable. The challenge in publishing data on the Web is providing
          an appropriate level of detail about its origin. The <a href="#data_producer">
            data producer</a> may not necessarily be the data provider and so
          collecting and conveying this corresponding metadata is particularly
          important. Without provenance, consumers have no inherent way to trust
          the integrity and credibility of the data being shared. Data
          publishers in turn need to be aware of the needs of prospective
          consumer communities to know how much provenance detail is
          appropriate. </p>

          Measures and metrics are defined to assess the quality for each

          assessment situations that rely on quality indicators, namely, pieces

        <h3>Data Versioning</h3>
        <p> Datasets published on the Web may change over time. Some datasets
          are updated on a scheduled basis, and other datasets are changed as
          improvements in collecting the data make updates worthwhile. In order
          to deal with these changes, new versions of a dataset may be created.
          Unfortunately, there is no consensus about when changes to a dataset should 
          cause it to be considered a different dataset altogether rather than a new version. 
          In the following, we present some scenarios where most publishers would agree that
          the revision should be considered a new version of the existing dataset. </p>
        <ul>
          <li> Scenario 1: a new bus stop is created and its timetable needs to be added to the dataset;</li>
          <li> Scenario 2: an existing bus stop is removed and its timetable
            should be deleted from the dataset;</li>
          <li> Scenario 3: an error was identified in one of the existing
            timetables stored in the dataset and this error must be corrected.</li>
        </ul>
        <p> In general, multiple datasets that represent time series or
          spatial series, e.g. the same kind of data for different regions
          or for different years, are not considered multiple versions of the same
          dataset. In this case, each dataset covers a different set of observations
          about the world and should be treated as a new dataset. This is also the case with a dataset that
          collects data about weekly weather forecasts for a given city, where
          every week a new dataset is created to store data about that
          specific week. </p>
        <p>Scenarios 1 and 2 might trigger a major version, whereas Scenario 1 would likely trigger only a minor version.
          But how you decide whether versions are minor or major is less important than that you avoid making
          changes without incrementing the version indicator. Even for small changes, it is important to keep track of the
          different dataset versions to make the dataset trustworthy. Publishers
          should remember that a given dataset may be in use by one or more
          data consumers, and they should take reasonable steps to inform those consumers when a new version is released.
          For real-time data, an automated timestamp can serve as a version identifier. 
          For each dataset, the publisher should take a
          consistent, informative approach to versioning, so data consumers can
          understand and work with the changing data. </p>

            <p>Version information makes a revision of a dataset uniquely identifiable.
              Uniqueness can be used by data consumers to determine whether and how data has
              changed over time and to determine specifically which version of a
              dataset they are working with. Good data versioning enables
              consumers to understand if a newer version of a dataset is
              available. Explicit versioning allows for repeatability in
              research, enables comparisons, and prevents confusion. Using
              unique version numbers that follow a standardized approach can
              also set consumer expectations about how the versions differ.</p>

            <p> The best method for providing versioning information
              will vary according to the context; however, there are some basic
              guidelines that can be followed, for example: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Include a unique version number or date as part of the metadata for
                the dataset. </li>
              <li>Use a consistent numbering scheme with a meaningful approach
                to incrementing digits, such as [[SchemaVer]]. </li>
              <!-- <li>Provide a description of what has changed since the previous
                version. </li> -->
              <li>If the data is made available through an API, the URI used to
                request the latest version of the data should not change as the
                versions change, but it should be possible to request a specific
                version through the API.
                <!--See <a href="#VersioningVocabularies">Vocabulary
                  versioning</a> for more on assigning stable URIs for the 'latest version' and for each snapshot.</p> -->
              </li>
              <li> Use Memento [[RFC7089]], or components thereof, to
                express temporal versioning of a dataset and to access the
                version that was operational at a given datetime. The Memento
                protocol aligns closely with the approach for assigning URIs to
                versions that is used for W3C
                specifications, described below.</li>

            <p>The Web Ontology Language [[OWL2-QUICK-REFERENCE]] and the

            <p class="subhead">Why</p>
            <p>When developers implement a client for your API, they may rely on specific characteristics that you have built into it, such as the schema or the format of a response. Avoiding breaking changes in your API minimizes breakage to client code. Communicating changes when they do occur enables developers to take advantage of new features and, in the rare case of a breaking change, take action. </p>

          <section class="outcome">
            <p class="subhead">Intended Outcome</p>
            <p>Developer code will continue to work. Developers will know of improvements you make and be able to make use of them. Breaking changes to your API will be rare, and if they occur, developers will have sufficient time and information to adapt their code. That will enable them to avoid breakage, enhancing trust.</p>
          </section>
          <section class="how">
            <p class="subhead">Possible Approach to Implementation</p>
          <p>When improving your API, focus on adding new calls or new, unrequired options rather than changing how existing calls work. Existing clients can ignore such changes and will continue functioning.</p>
            <p>If using a fully RESTful style, you should be able to avoid changes that affect developers by keeping home resource URIs constant and changing only elements that your users do not code to directly. If you need to change your data in ways that are not compatible with the extension points that you initially designed, then a completely new design is called for, and that means changes that break client code. In that case, itâs best to implement the changes as a new REST API, with a different home resource URI. </p>
          <p>If using an architectural style that does not allow you to make moderately significant changes without breaking client code, use versioning. Indicate the version in the response header. Version numbers should be reflected in your URIs or in request "accept" headers (using content negotiation). When versioning in URIs, include the version number as far to the left as possible. Keep the previous version available for developers whose code has not yet been adapted to the new version.</p>
          <aside class="example">Some examples of breaking changes to an API include
            <ul>
              <li>Removing a call;</li>
              <li>Changing the method used to make a call;</li>
              <li>Changing the URI of a resource used in a call;</li>
              <li>Adding a required parameter for a call;</li>
              <li>Changing the data type of a parameter;</li>
              <li>Changing the name of a key in a key-value response;</li>

            </ul>
          </aside>
          <p>Changes to the API should be announced on your API documentation site. To notify users directly of changes, it's a good idea to create a mailing list and encourage developers to join. You can then announce changes there, and this provides a nice mechanism for feedback as well. It also allows your users to help each other.</p>

        <h3>Data Identifiers</h3>
        <p>Identifiers take many forms and are used extensively in every
          information system. Data discovery, usage and citation on the Web
          depends fundamentally on the use of HTTP (or HTTPS) URIs: globally
          unique identifiers that can be looked up by dereferencing them over
          the Internet [[RFC3986]]. It is perhaps worth emphasizing some key
          points about URIs in the current context.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>URIs are 'dumb strings', that is, they carry no semantics. Their
            function is purely to identify a resource.</li>
          <li>Although the previous point is accurate, it would be perverse for
            a URI such as http://example.com/dataset.csv to return anything
            other than a CSV file. Human readability is helpful.</li>
          <li>When de-referenced (looked up), a single URI may offer the same
            resource in more than one format. http://example.com/dataset may
            offer the same data in, say, CSV, JSON and XML. The server returns
            the most appropriate format based on <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/Negotiation">
              content negotiation </a>.</li>
          <li>One URI may redirect to another.</li>
          <li>De-referencing a URI triggers a computer program to run on a
            server so that the URI acts as a call to an API. The server may
            therefore do something as simple as return a single, static file, or
            it may carry out complex processing. Precisely what processing is
            carried out, i.e. the software on the server, is completely
            independent of the URI itself.</li>

            <div class="issue">The table links to Designing URI Sets for the UK
              Public Sector. A newer version of this document (which was the
              first of its kind) exists but is on a <a href="https://github.com/UKGovLD/URI-patterns-core/blob/master/URI%20Patterns.md">GitHub
                repository</a>. It seems that this might happen due to changes in
              organisation behind data.gov.uk. If this happens, we should update
              the link to point to the new version.</div>
            <p>URIs can be long. In a dataset of even moderate size, storing
              each URI is likely to be repetitive and obviously wasteful.
              Instead, define locally unique identifiers for each element and
              provide data that allows them to be converted to globally unique
              URIs programmatically. The Metadata Vocabulary for Tabular Data
              [[tabular-metadata]] provides mechanisms for doing this within
              tabular data such as CSV files, in particular using <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/tabular-metadata/#uri-template-properties">URI
                template properties</a> such as the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/tabular-metadata/#cell-aboutUrl">about
                URL</a> property.</p>
            <p>Where a data publisher is unable or unwilling to manage its URI
              space directly for persistence, an alternative approach is to use
              a redirection service such as <a href="http://purl.org/">purl.org</a>.
              This provides persistent URIs that can be redirected as required
              so that the eventual location can be ephemeral. The <a href="http://www.purlz.org/">software
                behind such services </a> is freely available so that it can be
              installed and managed locally if required.</p>
            <p>Digital Object Identifiers <a href="http://www.doi.org/">(DOIs)</a>
              offer a similar alternative. These identifiers are defined
              independently of any Web technology but can be appended to a 'URI
              stub.' DOIs are an important part of the digital infrastructure
              for research data and and libraries. </p>
            <aside class="example">
              <p>The URI <code>http://data.mycity.example/public-transport/road/bus/dataset/timetable</code>
                has several features that support persistence:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>All names are subject to change over time but in choosing a
                  domain name, it is reasonable for John to assume that MyCity
                  will continue to exist and that it will continue to have a
                  government. Therefore, while cases like Yugoslavia prove that
                  even country names change and top level domains disappear
                  (like .yu), <code>mycity.gov</code> is as persistent as any
                  domain name can be.</li>
                <li>By putting data on the <code>data.mycity.example</code>
                  subdomain, John is creating a specific domain that can be
                  managed independently of any particular department.</li>
                <li>It is <em>not</em> safe to assume that a specific <em>department</em>
                  will persist. The authorities in MyCity might very well decide
                  that the Transport Agency should be merged with another to
                  create the Transport and Environment Agency. It is right,
                  therefore, not to include the name of the Transport Agency in
                  the URI, but to include the task from which the data comes, in
                  this case that of providing public transport.</li>
                <li>Likewise, the path segments of <code>/road</code> and <code>/bus</code>
                  take us further towards the specific dataset for which John is
                  responsible.</li>
                <li>The <code>/dataset</code> path segment is an indication
                  that the URI identifies a dataset, rather than, say, a
                  specific bus route.</li>
                <li>Finally <code>/timetable</code> leads us to the dataset
                  concerning bus timetables in MyCity.</li>
                <li>In DCAT terms, this would be the identifier for the dataset.
                  Specific distributions of the dataset are likely to be
                  identified by adding the relevant file extension to the URI,
                  such as <code>http://data.mycity.example/public-transport/road/bus/dataset/timetable.csv</code>,
                  <code>http://data.mycity.example/public-transport/road/bus/dataset/timetable.json</code>,
                  <code>http://data.mycity.example/public-transport/road/bus/dataset/timetable.ttl</code>
                  etc.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>These points cover the design aspects of a persistent URI. To
                cover the organizational aspect, MyCity should publish
                information about its URI design principles as well as a
                commitment to maintain the service in the long term.</p>

              there was someone to call; the third telephone made both of them
              more useful yet. Data becomes more valuable if it refers to other
              people's data about the same thing, the same place, the same
              concept, the same event, the same person, and so on. That means
              using the same identifiers across datasets and making sure that
              your identifiers can be referred to by other datasets. When those
              identifiers are HTTP URIs, they can be looked up and more data

              solve will have already been solved by other people. In the same
              way, if you're looking for a set of identifiers for obvious things
              like countries, currencies, subjects, species, proteins, cities
              and regions, Nobel prize winners â someone's done it already. The
              steps described for <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/ld-bp/#how-to-find-existing-vocabularies">discovering
                existing vocabularies</a> [[LD-BP]] can readily be adapted.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>ensure URI sets you use are published by a trusted group or
                organization;</li>
              <li>ensure URI sets have permanent URIs.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you can't find an existing set of identifiers that meet your
              needs then you'll need to create your own, following the patterns
              for URI persistence so that others will add value to your data by
              linking to it.</p>
            <aside class="example">
              <p>The URI given as an example in the previous Best Practice (<code>http://data.mycity.example/public-transport/road/bus/dataset/timetable</code>)
                identifies a dataset. Much of the URI can be reused to identify
                bus stops, routes and the type of bus used on a given service.
                For example, a suitable persistent URI for the 'Airport -
                Bullfrog' route would be:</p>
              <p><code>http://data.mycity.example/public-transport/road/bus/route/id/AB</code></p>
              <p>This has the same initial structure as for the dataset but
                rather than <code>/dataset</code> it now includes the path
                segment <code>/route</code> so that humans can see that the
                type of thing identified is a bus route. The <code>/id</code>
                segment indicates that the URI identifies something that is not
                an information resource, i.e. something you cannot retrieve over
                the Internet, and <code>/AB</code> is the local identifier for
                the actual bus route. Dereferencing this URI should result in an
                HTTP 303 redirect to a similar URL such as <code>http://data.mycity.example/public-transport/road/bus/route/doc/AB</code>
                that <em>describes</em>, i.e. gives information about, the AB
                bus route (note the substitution of <code>/doc</code> for <code>/id</code>).
                Jeni Tennison's work on <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/urls-in-data/">URLs
                  in Data</a> has more to say on this topic.</p>
              <p>In offering this advice, it is recognized that URIs can be
                long. In a dataset of even moderate size, storing each URI is
                likely to be repetitive and obviously wasteful. Instead, define
                locally unique identifiers for each element (such as <code>AB</code>
                in this example) and provide data that allows them to be
                converted to globally unique URIs programmatically. The Metadata
                Vocabulary for Tabular Data [[tabular-metadata]] provides
                mechanisms for doing this within tabular data such as CSV files,
                in particular using <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/tabular-metadata/#uri-template-properties">URI
                  template properties</a> such as the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/tabular-metadata/#cell-aboutUrl">about

            <p>The W3C provides a good example of how to do this. The
              (persistent) URI for this document is
              http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/WD-dwbp-20150224/. That identifier
              points to an immutable snapshot of the document on the day of its
              publication. The URI for the 'latest version' of this document is
              http://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/ which is an identifier for a series of
              closely related documents that are subject to change over time. At
              the time of publication, these two URIs both resolve to this
              document. However, when the next version of this document is
              published, the 'latest version' URI will be changed to point to
              that. </p>

        <h3>Data Formats</h3>
        <p>The formats in which data is made available to consumers are a key
          aspect of making that data usable. The best, most flexible access
          mechanism in the world is pointless unless it serves data in formats
          that enable use and reuse. Below we detail best practices in selecting
          formats for your data, both at the level of files and that of
          individual fields. W3C encourages use of formats that can be used by
          the widest possible audience and processed most readily by computing
          systems. Source formats, such as database dumps or spreadsheets, used
          to generate the final published format, are out of scope. This
          document is concerned with what is actually published rather than
          internal systems used to generate the published data.</p>

          <section class="axioms">
            <p class="subhead">Why</p>
            <p>As data becomes more ubiquitous, and datasets become larger and
              more complex, processing by computers becomes ever more crucial.
              Posting data in a format that is not machine readable places
              severe limitations on the continuing usefulness of the data. Data
              becomes useful when it has been processed and transformed into
              information. </p>
            <p> Using non-standard data formats is costly and inefficient, and
              the data may lose meaning as it is transformed. On the other hand,
              standardized data formats enable interoperability as well as
              future uses, such as remixing or visualization, many of which
              cannot be anticipated when the data is first published. The use of
              non-proprietary data formats should also be considered since it
              increases the possibilities for use and reuse of data </p>

        <h3>Data Vocabularies</h3>
        <!--<div class="issue"> There is a discussion going on in the group if the
          creation (and publication) of vocabularies is in the scope of the DWBP          document.</div>-->
        <p>Data is often represented in a structured and controlled way, making
          reference to a range of vocabularies, for example, by defining types
          of nodes and links in a data graph or types of values for columns in a
          table, such as the subject of a book, or a relationship âknowsâ
          between two persons. Additionally, the values used may come from a
          limited set of pre-existing values or resources: for example object
          types, roles of a person, countries in a geographic area, or possible
          subjects for books. Such vocabularies ensure a level of control,
          standardization and interoperability in the data. They can also serve
          to improve the usability of datasets. Say, a dataset contains a
          reference to a concept described in several languages. Such reference
          allows applications to localize their display of their search
          depending on the language of the user. </p>
        <p>According to W3C, <a href="http://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/ontology">vocabularies</a>
          define the concepts and relationships (also referred to as âtermsâ or
          âattributesâ) used to describe and represent an area of concern.
          Vocabularies are used to classify the terms that can be used in a
          particular application, characterize possible relationships, and
          define possible constraints on using those terms. Several categories
          of vocabularies have been coined, for example, ontology, controlled
          vocabulary, thesaurus, taxonomy, code list, semantic network.</p>
        <p>There is no strict division between the artifacts referred to by
          these names. âOntologyâ tends however to denote the vocabularies of
          classes and properties that structure the descriptions of resources in
          (linked) datasets. In relational databases, these correspond to the
          names of tables and columns; in XML, they correspond to the elements
          defined by an XML Schema. Ontologies are the key building blocks for
          inference techniques on the Semantic Web. The first means offered by
          W3C for creating ontologies is the RDF Schema [[RDF-SCHEMA]] language.
          It is possible to define more expressive ontologies with additional
          axioms using languages such as those in The Web Ontology Language
          [[OWL2-OVERVIEW]]. </p>
        <p>On the other hand, âcontrolled vocabulariesâ, âconcept schemesâ,
          âknowledge organization systemsâ enumerate and define resources that
          can be employed in the descriptions made with the former kind of
          vocabulary. A concept from a thesaurus, say, âarchitectureâ, will for
          example be used in the subject field for a book description (where
          âsubjectâ has been defined in an ontology for books). For defining the
          terms in these vocabularies, complex formalisms are most often not
          needed. Simpler models have thus been proposed to represent and
          exchange them, such as the ISO 25964 data model [[ISO-25964]] or W3C's
          Simple Knowledge Organization System [[SKOS-PRIMER]].</p>

          <section class="how">
            <p class="subhead">Possible Approach to Implementation</p>
            <p>Values in datasets should refer as much as possible to
              standardization efforts or organizations, which defines terms or codes as a
              clear reference.</p>
            <p>Organizations like the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC), ISO, W3C, libraries and research data services, etc., provide
              list of codes, terminologies or even Linked Data vocabularies that can be used for this.</p>
            <p>A key point is to make sure the dataset or its documentation provides enough (human- and machine-readable) context 
              for the values, so that data consumers can retrieve and exploit the standardized meaning
              of these values. In the context of the Web, using unambiguous, web-based identifiers for standardized values
              is an efficient way to do this.</p>

            <p>4. Google maintains a <a href="https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/">General Transit Feed Specification</a> that defines
              a format for publishing public transportation data. This format relies on a set of fields like <code>route_short_name</code> or
              <code>route_type</code> that are
              <a href="https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/reference#field-definitions">carefully defined</a>
              and exposed to constant community feedback in order to facilitate consensus, which leads to easier adoption and greater interoperability.
              Definitions include specifications of coded values for some fields, as in the following extract for <code>route_type</code> codes:</p>
<pre style="" class="highlight prettyprint prettyprinted">

              <p>Note that in a non-linked data fashion, these fields and codes have no individual Web identifiers nor machine-readable semantics.
             Exploiting them thus requires implementers to parse the documentation and encode interpretations in each individual application consuming the data.

              discovery, evaluation and selection of existing vocabularies.</p>
            <aside class="example">
	    <p>1. All examples in this document show how common vocabularies (PROV, SKOS, etc) can be reused 
              to express data and metadata statements, instead of minting entirely new classes and properties.</p>
              <p>2. The DCAT vocabulary to express metadata on datasets [<cite><a href="#bib-VOCAB-DCAT" class="bibref">VOCAB-DCAT</a></cite>] 
              re-uses elements from Dublin Core, FOAF, SKOS and vCard, see its 
              <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat/#namespaces-1">namespaces</a> section. 
              For example, reusing Dublin Core properties like <code>dct:title</code> instead of 
              creating new ones (say, <code>dcat:title</code>) enables DCAT-based metadata 
              to be consumed by any application that can read and manipulate Dublin Core statements.</p>
              <p>3. In the digital culture sector, the data model for the initiative 
              <a href="http://europeana.eu">Europeana</a> (<a href="http://www.europeana.eu/schemas/edm/">EDM</a>) 
              also widely re-uses existing shared vocabularies like Dublin Core, FOAF, SKOS, etc. 
              This has facilitated adoption of EDM by Europeana's data providers and helped 
              position it as a best practice for similar initiatives in the same sector.
              For instance, <a href="http://dp.la/info/map/">metadata application profile</a> from the 
              <a href="http://dp.la">Digital Public Library of America</a> reuses EDM and thus 
              the various vocabularies that EDM builds on. As a result, large amounts of 
              digital culture data have become more interoperable within the sector. That data is 
              also easier to reuse by consumers from other communities, who are not familiar
              with the traditional models and terminologies used by library, archives and museums.</p>

          <p class="subhead">Why</p>
          <p>Formal semantics help to establish precise specifications
            that support establishing the intended meaning of the vocabulary and
            the performance of complex tasks such as reasoning. On the other
            hand, complex vocabularies require more effort to produce and
            understand, which could hamper their reuse, as well as the
            comparison and linking of datasets exploiting them. Highly
            formalized data is also harder to exploit by inference engines: for
            example, using an OWL class in a position where a SKOS concept is
            enough, or using OWL classes with complex OWL axioms raises the
            formal complexity of the data according to the OWL Profiles
            [[OWL2-PROFILES]]. Data producers should therefore seek to identify
            the right level of formalization for particular domains, audiences
            and tasks, and maybe offer different formalization levels when one
            size does not fit all.</p>

        <section class="how">
          <p class="subhead">Possible Approach to Implementation</p>
          <p>Identify the "role" played by the vocabulary for the datasets, say,
            providing classes and properties used to type resources and provide
            the predicates for RDF statements, or elements in an XML Schema, as
            opposed to providing simple concepts or codes that are used for
            representing attributes of the resources described in a dataset.
            When simpler data models are enough to convey the necessary semantics,
            represent vocabularies using them.</p>
          <p>Even when a language with rich formal semantics like OWL is used to 
            express a vocabulary, it is preferable that this vocabulary has a minimal
            <emph>ontological commitment</emph>, i.e. by featuring only the formal axioms
            that enable inferences and validation checks
            that have been explicitly identified as relevant for the domain or application at hand.
            The more axioms are used to specify a vocabulary, the narrower its usage is;
            unnecessary axioms unnecessarily constrain the reuse of a vocabulary 
            across applications.</p>
          <aside class="example">
          <p>1. For expressing simple vocabularies like thesauri or code lists as Linked Data,
            a simpler data model like SKOS may be preferred over formal
            ontology languages like OWL; see for example how <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-data-cube/#schemes">concept
              schemes and code lists</a> are represented and used in the RDF Data Cube
            Recommendation [[VOCAB-DATA-CUBE]].</p>
          <p>2. Designers of the SKOS ontology itself have minimized its ontological commitment by questioning
            all formal axioms that were suggested for its classes and properties. Often they have been rejected 
            because their use, while beneficial to many applications, would have created 
            formal inconsistencies for the data from other applications, making SKOS not usable at all
            for these. As an example, the property <code>skos:broader</code> was not defined
            as a transitive property, even though it would have fit the way hierarchical links between concepts
            are created for many thesauri [[SKOS-DESIGN]].</p>
          <p>3. The vocabularies for Data Quality [[DQV]] and Data Usage [[DUV]] created by the W3C Working 
            Group publishing this document have also sought to minimize the number of formal 
            axioms involved in their definition. For instance, the property <code>dqv:hasQualityMeasurement</code>
            has no formal domain in the RDFS/OWL sense, even though it is expected to be most often used with
            resources that are of type <code>dcat:Dataset</code> or <code>dcat:Distribution</code>.
            This allows application designers to employ it for other types of entities, for which
            quality measurements would also be relevant but that were not in the focus of
            the design process for DQV.</p>
          <p>4. The <a href="http://schema.org">Schema.org</a> schemas for publishing structured 
            data on the web have adopted an informative rather than normative approach for defining 
            the types of objects these properties can be used with. For instance, the values of the property 
            <a href="http://schema.org/author"><code>author</code></a> are only "expected" to be 
            of type <code>Organization</code> or <code>Person</code>. <code>author</code> "can be used" on the 
            type <code>CreativeWork</code> but this is not a strict constraint.</p>

      <h3>Sensitive Data</h3>
      <p>To support best practices for publishing sensitive data, data
        publishers should identify all sensitive data, assess the exposure risk,
        determine the intended usage, data user audience and any related usage
        policies, obtain appropriate approval, and determine the appropriate
        security measures needed to taken to protect the data, which should also
        account for secure authentication and use of HTTPS.</p>
      <p>Data publishers should preserve the privacy of individuals where the
        release of personal information would endanger safety (unintended
        accidents) or security (deliberate attack). Privacy information might
        include: full name, home address, mail address, national identification
        number, IP address (in some cases), vehicle registration plate number,
        driver's license number, face, fingerprints, or handwriting, credit card
        numbers, digital identity, date of birth, birthplace, genetic
        information, telephone number, login name, screen name, nickname, health
        records etc.</p>
      <p> At times, because of sharing policies sensitive data may not be
        available in part or in its entirety. Data unavailability represents
        gaps that may affect the overall analysis of datasets. To account for
        unavailable data, data publishers should publish information about
        unavoidable data gaps.</p>

            identify knowledge gaps. This provides a contextual explanation for
            consumer communities thus encouraging use of the data that <em>is</em>

      <h3>Data Access</h3>
      <p>Providing easy access to data on the Web enables both humans and
        machines to take advantage of the benefits of sharing data using the Web
        infrastructure. By default, the Web offers access using Hypertext
        Transfer Protocol (HTTP) methods. This provides access to data at an
        atomic transaction level. However, when data is distributed across
        multiple files or requires more sophisticated retrieval methods
        different approaches can be adopted to enable data access, including
        bulk download and <abbr title="Application Programming Interfaces">API</abbr>s.
        </p>
      <p>One approach is packaging data in bulk using non-proprietary file
        formats (for example tar files). Using this approach, bulk data is
        generally pre-processed server side where multiple files or directory
        trees of files are provided as one downloadable file. When bulk data is
        being retrieved from non-file system solutions, depending on the data
        user communities, the data publisher can offer APIs to support a series
        of retrieval operations representing a single transaction.</p>
      <p>For data that is streaming to the Web in âreal timeâ or ânear real
        timeâ, data publishers should publish data or use APIs to enable
        immediate access to data, allowing access to critical time sensitive
        data, such as emergency information, weather forecasting data, or
        published system metrics. In general, APIs should be available to allow
        third parties to automatically search and retrieve data published on the
        Web. </p>
      <p>On a further note, it can be observed that data on the Web is
        essentially about the description of entities identified by a unique,
        Web-based, identifier (an URI). Once the data is dumped and sent to an
        institute specialised in digital preservation the link with the Web is
        broken (dereferencing) but the role of the URI as a unique identifier
        still remains. In order to increase the usability of preserved dataset
        dumps it is relevant to maintain a list of these identifiers. </p>

        <p class="practicedesc">Data should be available for bulk download. </p>
        <section class="axioms">
          <p class="subhead">Why</p>
          <p>When web data is distributed across many URIs but might logically
            be organized as one container, accessing the data in bulk can be useful.
            Bulk access provides a consistent means to handle the data as one
            container. Individually accessing data over many retrievals can be cumbersome
            and, if used to reassemble the complete dataset, can lead to inconsistent approaches to handling the data.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="outcome">
          <p class="subhead">Intended Outcome</p>
          <p> It should be possible to download data on the Web in bulk. Data
            publishers should provide a way, through either a single-file download or
            a single API call, for consumers to access all the data. Large file transfers (which would require more time than a typical user would consider reasonable) should be enabled by dedicated file-transfer protocols. The bulk download should include the metadata describing the dataset. Discovery metadata [[VOCAB-DCAT]] should also be available outside the bulk downlaod.

          <p class="subhead">Possible Approach to Implementation</p>
          <p>Depending on the nature of the data and consumer needs, possible
            approaches could include the following:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Preprocessing a copy of the data into a compressed archive format
              and making the data accessible from one URI. This is
              particularly useful for handling data that changes infrequently.</li>
            <li>Hosting an API that includes the ability to
              retrieve a bulk download in addition to dynamic queries. This
              approach is useful for capturing a complete snapshot of dynamic data.</li>
            <li>For very large datasets, bulk file transfers can be enabled via means other than http, such as <a href="http://www.slac.stanford.edu/~abh/bbcp/">bbcp</a> or <a href="http://toolkit.globus.org/toolkit/docs/latest-stable/gridftp/">GridFTP</a>.</li>
          </ul>
          <aside class="example">
            <p>The MyCity transit agency may want to make historical arrival data for 2015 available as a bulk download containing multiple CSV files for a hackathon.

        <p class="practicedesc">If your dataset is large, enable users and applications to readily work with useful subsets of your data.</p>
        <section class="axioms">
          <p class="subhead">Why</p>
          <p>Large datasets can be difficult to move from place to place. It can also be inconvenient for users to store or parse a large dataset. Users should not have to download a complete dataset if they only need a subset of it. Moreover, web applications that tap into large datasets will perform better if their developers can take advantage of âlazy loadingâ, working with smaller pieces of a whole and pulling in new pieces only as needed. The ability to work with subsets of the data also enables offline processing to work more efficiently. Real-time applications benefit in particular, as they can update more quickly.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="outcome">
          <p class="subhead">Intended Outcome</p>
          <p> Both human users and applications should be able to access subsets of a dataset, rather than the entire thing, as needed. Subsetting approaches should aim for a high ratio of needed data to unneeded data for the largest number of users. Static datasets that users in the domain would consider to be large should be downloadable in smaller pieces. APIs should make slices or filtered subsets of the data available, the granularity depending on the needs of the domain and the demands of performance in a web application.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="how">
          <p class="subhead">Possible Approaches to Implementation</p>
          <p>Consider the expected use cases for your dataset and determine what types of subsets are likely to be most useful. An API is usually the most flexible approach to serving subets of data, as it allows customization of what data is transferred, making the available subsets much more likely to provide the needed data--and little unneeded data--for any given situation. The granularity should be suitable for web application access speeds. (An API call that  returns within one second enables an application to deliver interactivity that feels natural. Data that takes more than ten seconds to deliver will likely cause users to suspect failure.)</p>
          <aside class="example">
            <p>The MyCity transit API offers information about individual buses, bus stops, and time points. It can accept a query for all the timepoints for a single stop on a single bus route, or it can accept one for all the buses along one route at one time point, or it can accept one for all the time points for a single bus on a single route. These small slices through the data enable web applications to update data quickly and deliver it to riders on demand, interactively. </p>
          </aside>
          <p>Another way to subset a dataset is to simply split it into smaller units and make those units individually available for download or viewing.</p>
          <aside class="example">
            <p>The MyCity transit agency has a set of nicely formatted single-route schedules available in PDF format. Users can select the route they plan to ride from a menu and view or download the schedule for that route alone.</p>
          </aside>
            <p>It can also be helpful to mark up a dataset so that individual sections through the data (or even smaller pieces, if expected use cases warrant it) can be processed separately. One way to do that is by indicating âslicesâ with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-data-cube/#cubes-slices">RDF Data Cube Vocabulary</a>.</p>

        <p class="practicedesc">When designing APIs, it is recommended to use an architectural style that is founded on the technologies of the Web itself. Web standards such as URIs, HTTP verbs, HTTP response codes, MIME types, typed HTTP Links, and content negotiation can all help solve difficult problems and enable you to build a flexible and useful data service. </p>
        <section class="axioms">
          <p class="subhead">Why</p>
          <p>APIs that are built on Web standards leverage the strengths of the Web. For example, using HTTP verbs as methods and URIs that map directly to individual resources helps to avoid tight coupling between requests and responses, making for an API that is easy to maintain and can readily be understood and used by many developers. The statelessness of the Web can be a strength in enabling quick scaling, and using hypermedia enables rich interactions with your API. </p>

        <section class="how">
          <p class="subhead">Possible Approaches to Implementation</p>
          <p>REST (REpresentational State Transfer) is an architectural style that, when used in a web API, takes advantage of the architecture of the Web itself. A full discussion of how to build a RESTful API is beyond the scope of this document, but there are many resources and a strong community that can help in getting started. There are also many RESTful development frameworks available. If you are already using a Web development framework that supports building REST APIs, consider using that. If not, consider an API-only framework that uses REST.</p>
          <p>Another aspect of implementation to consider is making a hypermedia API, one that responds with links rather than data alone. Links are what make the Web a web, and data APIs can be more useful and usable by including links in their responses. The links can offer additional resources, documentation, and navigation. Even for an API that does not meet all the constraints of REST, returning links in responses can make for a service that is rich and self-documenting. </p>

            real-time web applications. Real-time access is dependent on
            real-time data producers making their data readily available to the
            data publisher. The necessity of providing real-time access for a
            given application will need to be evaluated on a case by case basis
            considering refresh rates, latency introduced by data post
            processing steps, infrastructure availability, and the data needed
            by consumers. In addition to making data accessible, data publishers
            may provide additional information describing data gaps, data errors

          <ul>
            <li> Push - as data is produced the producers communicates data to
              the data publisher either by disseminating data to the publisher
              or making storage available accessible to the data producer.</li>
            <li>On-Demand (Pull) - available real-time data is made available
              upon request. In this case, data publishers will provide an API to
              facilitate these read-only requests.</li>
          </ul>
          In addition to data access, to ensure credibility providing access to
          error conditions, anomalies, and instrument "house keeping" data
          enhance real-time applications ability to interpret and convey
          real-time data quality to consumers.

          To adequately test real time data access, data will need to be tracked
          from the time it is initially collected to the time it is published
          and accessed. [[PROV-O]] can be used to describe these activities.
          Caution should be used when analyzing real-time access for systems
          that consist of multiple computer systems. For example, tests that
          rely on wall clock time stamps may reflect inconsistencies between the
          individual computer systems as opposed to data publication time
          latency.

            <p>Those triples make use of the "gtfs" vocabulary and a custom one
              defined in the testing domain name "ex". It also uses entities
              defined in "foaf", "dbpedia" and "ex". Although not formal
              standards, FOAF and GTFS [[GTFS]] are well established ontologies
              that are archived in several places on the Web (see, for instance,
              <a href="http://lov.okfn.org">the LOV repository</a>). Entities
              defined in DBpedia are also preserved through their <a href="http://mementoweb.org/depot/native/dbpedia/">Memento
                gateway</a> and archived dumps of the dataset also exist. The
              risks associated to preserving the triple making use of those
              external resource is thus minimal. A bigger concern arises from
              the usage made of resources defined in "ex" which is a namespace
              that, by design, does not exist outside of the dataset. Unless the
              data describing "ex:usualVehicleType", "ex:Airport_Bullfrog" and
              "ex:Bullfrog_Furnace_Creek_Resort" is preserved alongside those
              triples their contextual meaning will be lost. This is
              particularly critical for "ex:usualVehicleType" as without it the
              relationship between the described route and the dbpedia resources
              will be unknown to a consuming application (however obvious it may
              be to a human).</p>
            <p>Considering this assessment, a revised dataset including the

              preservation:</p>

            in order to still be usable with more modern software (see
            [[ROSENTHAL]]). This task can be made more challenging, or even

        <section class="axioms">
          <p class="subhead">Why</p>
          <p>URI dereferencing is a primary interface to data on the Web.
            Linking preserved datasets with the original URI informs the data
            consumer (which might be a computer programme) that there are other, more recent, versions and facilitates determining the status of these resources.</p>
          <p>During its life cycle a dataset may undergo several modifications resulting in multiple versions.
            Although URIs assigned to things are not expected to change, the
            description of these resource will evolve over time.
            <!--There are also some new IRIs that will be put into use, some
              other that will become deprecated, and some that will get deleted. -->
            During this evolution, several snapshots could be made available for
            preservation and accessed as earlier versions of the current dataset.</p>

        <section class="outcome">
          <p class="subhead">Intended Outcome</p>
          <p>A link is maintained between the URI of a resource, the most
            up-to-date description available for it, and preserved descriptions.
            If the dataset resource does not exist any more then the description should say
            so and refer to the last preserved description that was available.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="how">
          <p class="subhead">Possible Approach to Implementation</p>
          <p>There are a variety of HTTP status codes that could be put into use
            to relate the URI with its preserved description. In particular,
            200, 410 and 303 can be used for different scenarios:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>200 =&gt; there is a new description which contains pointers to the
              archived description</li>
            <!--              <li>404 =&gt; the resource just died, the URI consumer has to go
                find an archive to look for it</li> -->
            <li>410 =&gt; the resource is no longer available but it has been
              removed under a controlled process cf. 404 which simply states
              that something is not available.</li>
            <li>303 =&gt; the resource identified by this URI is no longer
              served here but there is a preserved description at a different
              location.</li>
            <!--              <li>209 =&gt; this resource does not exist any more but we have
                some information about it. The description could include a list                of locations having different preserved descriptions over                different times.</li> -->
          </ul>
          <p>In addition to the status codes, HTTP Link headers can also be used
            to relate resources to their preserved descriptions.</p>
          <aside class="example">
            <p>One approach with a link header is to use the Memento protocol to
              give a link to a timegate providing access to the preserved
              descriptions of the resource:</p>
            <pre class="highlight">curl -I http://example.org/timetable-001

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Memento-Datetime: Sun, 05 April 2015 00:00:00 GMT

            </pre>
            <p>Using HTTP status code the data consumer can be redirected to the
              most recent description of the entity. In the following example a
              request for the resource "http://example.org/timetable-001" is
              first redirected to the description
              "http://example.org/data/timetable-001" which, as it has been
              preserved and flagged as invalid, redirects the client to the
              newer description "http://example.org/newdata/timetable-001"</p>

      <h3>Feedback</h3>
      <p>Publishing data on the Web enables data sharing on a large scale,
        providing data access to a wide range of audiences with different levels
        of expertise. Data publishers want to ensure that the data published is
        meeting the data consumer needs and user feedback is crucial. Feedback
        has benefits for both data publishers and data consumers, helping data
        publishers to improve the integrity of their published data, as well as
        to encourage the publication of new data. Feedback allows data consumers
        to have a voice describing usage experiences (e.g. applications using
        data), preferences and needs. When possible, feedback should also be
        publicly available for other data consumers to examine. Making feedback
        publicly available allows users to become aware of other data consumers,
        supports a collaborative environment, and allows user community
        experiences, concerns or questions are currently being addressed.</p>
      <p>From a user interface perspective there are different ways to gather
        feedback from data consumers, including site registration, contact
        forms, quality ratings selection, surveys and comment boxes for
        blogging. From a machine perspective the data publisher can also record
        metrics on data usage or information about specific applications
        consumers are currently relying upon. Feedback such as this establishes
        a line of communication channel between data publishers and data
        consumers. In order to quantify and analyze usage feedback, it should be
        recorded in a machine-readable format. Blogs and other publicly
        available feedback should be displayed in a human-readable form through
        the user interface. </p>
      <p> This section provides some BP to be followed by data publishers in

        data. This feedback can be for humans or machines. </p>

      <h3>Data Enrichment</h3>
      <p>Data enrichment refers to a set of processes that can be used to
        enhance, refine or otherwise improve raw or previously processed data.
        This idea and other similar concepts contribute to making data a
        valuable asset for almost any modern business or enterprise.</p>
      <p>This section provides some advice to be followed by data publishers in
        order to enrich data.</p>
      <!-- begin of BP Enrich data -->
      <div class="practice">
        <p><span id="EnrichData" class="practicelab">Enrich data by generating
            new data.</span></p>
        <p class="practicedesc">Enrich your data by generating new data from the raw data when doing so will enhance its value.</p>
        <section class="axioms">
          <p class="subhead">Why</p>
          <p>Enrichment can greatly enhance processability, particularly for unstructured data. Missing values can be filled in, and new attributes and measures can be added. Publishing more complete datasets enhances trust. Deriving additional values that are of general utility saves users time and encourages more kinds of reuse. There are many intelligent techniques that can be used to enrich data, making the dataset an even more valuable asset.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="outcome">
          <p class="subhead">Intended Outcome</p>
          <p>A dataset that has missing values should be enhanced if possible to fill in those values. Additional relevant measures or attributes should be added if they enhance utility. Unstructured data can be given structure in this way as well.</p>
          <p>Because inference-based enrichment may introduce errors into the data, values generated by such techniques should be labeled as such, and it should be possible to retrieve any original values replaced by enrichment.</p>
          <p>Whenever licensing permits, the code used to enrich the data should be made available along with the dataset. Sharing such code is particularly important for scientific data. </p>
        </section>
        <section class="how">
          <p class="subhead"> Possible Approaches to Implementation</p>
          <p> Machine learning can be readily applied to the enrichment of data. Methods include those focused on data categorization, disambiguation, entity recognition, sentiment analysis, and topification, among others. After new data is extracted, it can be provided as part of any open data format.</p>
          <p>New data values may be derivable as simply as performing a mathematical calculation across existing columns. Other examples include visual inspection to identify features in spatial data and cross-reference to external databases for demographic information. </p>
          <aside class="example">
            <p>The MyCity transport agency has street addresses for each of its transit stops. It wants to make it easier for consumers of its data to combine the data with maps, so it adds latitude and longitude information for each stop by utilizing a geographic database.</p>
          </aside>
          <aside class="example">
            <p>The transit agency has a large collection of email correspondence from transit riders. Some of the correspondence is complementary, some is complaints, and some is requesting information. The agency conducts a combination of sentiment analysis and categorization to extract metadata for each of the messages, such as transit mode, route number, and rider positivity, to create a semistructured dataset.</p>

Check whether the metadata being extracted is in accordance with human knowledge and readable by humans.</p>

          <p class="subhead">Why</p>
          <p>Data published online is meant to inform others about its subject. But only posting datasets for download or API access puts the burden on consumers to interpret it. The web offers unparalleled opportunities for presenting data in ways that let users learn and explore without having to create their own tools.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="outcome">
          <p class="subhead">Intended Outcome</p>
          <p>Besides making datasets available for download, processing, and reuse, publishers should give human consumers immediate insight into the data by presenting it in ways that are readily understood. Data consumers should not have to create their own tools to understand the meaning of the data.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="how">
          <p class="subhead"> Possible Approaches to Implementation</p>
          <p> One very simple way to provide immediate insight is to publish an analytical summary in an HTML page. Including summative data in graphs or tables can help users scan the summary and quickly understand the meaning of the data.</p>
          <p>If you have the means to create interactive visualizations or web applications that use the data, you can give consumers of your data greater ability to understand it and discover patterns in it. These approaches also demonstrate its suitability for processing and encourage reuse.</p>
          <aside class="example">
            <p>The MyCity transit agency publishes detailed data about all its transit lines through an API, but it also has many users who are not web developers and who want to know how to use the system to move about the city. The transit agency could build a web application that allows users to enter a departure address and a destination and receive step-by-step directions for making their journey via public transit. </p>
