      <p>This document provides Best Practices related to the
        publication and usage of data on the Web designed to help support a
        self-sustaining ecosystem. Data should be discoverable and
        understandable by humans and machines. Where data is used in some way,
        whether by the originator of the data or by an external party, such
        usage should also be discoverable and the efforts of the data publisher
        recognized. In short, following these Best Practices will facilitate
        interaction between publishers and consumers.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="sotd">
      <!-->The Working Group <strong>invites publishers to test</strong> whether their datasets pass or fail each of the Best Practices in this document using the <a href="http://w3c.br/form-dwbp/">DWBP Evidences Form</a>. The information gathered through this means will be augmented by further analysis of data available on the Web and, as <a href="https://www.w3.org/2013/05/odbp-charter#deliverables">noted in the charter</a>, national or sector-specific guidelines that reference the Best Practices. The Working Group expects to adduce the combined set of evidence when requesting that the Director advance this document to Proposed Recommendation.</p> -->

<p>The Working Group has demonstrated evidence that each of the best practices has been recommended or adopted in at least two environments, such as data portals and formal policies. Evidence of implementation was gathered from existing datasets and data portals, which already implement the proposed best practices, as well as from national or sector-specific guidelines that reference the DWBP and documents available on the Web. It is worth to mention that well-known organizations as well as high profile datasets and data portals worldwide like <a href="http://wiki.dbpedia.org/">DBpedia</a>, <a href="https://data.gov.uk/">Data.gov.uk</a>, <a href="https://data.gov/">Data.gov</a> and <a href="http://data.worldbank.org/"> World Bank</a> implement the DWBP.</p>


    </section>
    <section id="intro" class="informative">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>The Best Practices described below have been developed to encourage and
        enable the continued expansion of the Web as a medium for the exchange
        of data. The growth in online sharing of open data by governments across the world
        [[OKFN-INDEX]] [[ODB]], the increasing online publication of research data encouraged
        by organizations like the Research Data Alliance [[RDA]], the harvesting,
        analysis and online publishing of social media data, crowd-sourcing of information, the
        increasing presence on the Web of important cultural heritage collections such as at the
        Bibliothèque nationale de France [[BNF]] and the sustained growth in the
        Linked Open Data Cloud [[LODC]], provide some examples of this growth in
        the use of Web for publishing data.</p>
<p>However, this growth is not consistent in style and in many cases does not make use of the full potential of the Open Web Platform's ability to link one fact to another, to discover related resources and to create interactive visualizations.</p>
      <p>In broad terms, data publishers aim to share data either openly or with
        controlled access. Data consumers (who may also be producers themselves)
        want to be able to find, use and link to the data, especially if it is accurate,
        regularly updated and guaranteed to be available at all times. This
        creates a fundamental need for a common understanding between data
        publishers and data consumers. Without this agreement, data publishers'
        efforts may be incompatible with data consumers' desires.</p>
      <p>The openness and flexibility of the Web create new challenges for data
        publishers and data consumers, such as how to
        represent, describe and make data available in a way that it will be
        easy to find and to understand. In contrast to conventional databases,
        for example, where there is a single data model to represent the data
        and a database management system (DBMS) to control data access, data on
        the Web allows for the existence of multiple ways to represent and to
        access data. For more details about the challenges see the section <a href="#challenges">Data on the Web Challenges</a>.</p>
      <p>In this context, it becomes crucial to
        provide guidance to publishers that will improve consistency in the way
        data is managed. Such guidance will promote the reuse of data and foster
        trust in the data among developers, whatever technology they choose to
        use, increasing the potential for genuine innovation.</p>
      <p>Not all data and metadata should be shared openly, however. Security, commercial sensitivity and, above all, individuals' privacy need to be taken into account. It is for data publishers to determine policy on which data should be shared and under what circumstances. Data sharing policies are likely to assess the exposure risk and determine the appropriate security measures to be taken to protect sensitive data, such as secure authentication and authorization.</p>

<p>Depending on circumstances, sensitive information about individuals might include full name, home address, email address, national identification number, IP address, vehicle registration plate number, driver's license number, face, fingerprints, or handwriting, credit card numbers, digital identity, date of birth, birthplace, genetic information, telephone number, login name, screen name, nickname, health records etc. Although it is likely to be safe to share some of that information openly, and even more within a controlled environment, publishers should bear in mind that combining data from multiple sources may allow inadvertent identification of individuals.</p>

      <p>A general Best Practice for publishing Data on the Web is to use standards. Different types of organizations specify standards that are specific to the publishing of datasets related to particular domains &amp; applications, involving communities of users interested in that data. These standards define a common way of communicating information among the users of these communities. For example, there are two standards that can be used to publish transport timetables: the General Transit Feed Specification [[GTFS]] and the Service Interface for Real Time Information [[SIRI]]. These specify, in a mixed way, standardized terms, standardized data formats and standardized data access. Another general Best Practice is to use Unicode for handling character and string data. Unicode improves multilingual text processing and makes easier software localization easier. The Best Practices set out in this document serve a general purpose of publishing and using Data on the Web and are domain &amp; application independent. They can be extended or complemented by other Best Practices documents or standards that cover more specialized contexts.</p>
<!--      <p>Taking that into account, this document sets out a series of Best Practices that will help publishers and consumers face the new challenges and opportunities posed by data on the Web. They intend to serve a general purpose of publishing and using Data on the Web, but they may be specialized according to specific domains, such as Spatial Data on the Web Best Practices [[SDW-BP]].</p>-->
      <p>Best Practices cover different aspects related to data publishing and
        consumption, like data formats, data access, data identifiers and
        metadata. In order to delimit the scope and elicit the required features
        for Data on the Web Best Practices, the <abbr title="Data on the Web Best Practices">DWBP</abbr>
        working group compiled a set of use cases [[DWBP-UCR]] that represent
        scenarios of how data is commonly published on the Web and how it is
        used. The set of requirements derived from these use cases were used to
        guide the development of the Best Practices.</p>
      <p>The Best Practices proposed in this document are intended to serve a
        more general purpose than the practices suggested in, for example, Best Practices for
        Publishing Linked Data [[LD-BP]] since DWBP is domain-independent. Whilst DWBP recommends the use of Linked Data, it also promotes best
        practices for data on the Web in other open formats such as CSV. Methods for sharing tabular data, including CSV files, in a way that maximizes the potential of the Web to make links between data points, are described in the Tabular Data Primer [[Tabular-Data-Primer]]. <!--The Best Practices related to the use of vocabularies
        incorporate practices that stem from Best Practices for Publishing
        Linked Data where appropriate.</p>-->
      <p>In order to encourage data publishers to adopt the DWBP, a number of distinct benefits were identified: comprehension; processability; discoverability; reuse; trust; linkability; access; and interoperability. They are described and related to the Best Practices in the section <a href="#BP_Benefits">Best Practices Benefits</a>.</p>

      <h2>Audience</h2>
      <p>This document sets out Best Practices tailored primarily for those who publish data on the
        Web. The Best Practices are designed to meet the needs of information
        management staff, developers, and wider groups such as scientists
        interested in sharing and reusing research data on the Web. While data
        publishers are our primary audience, we encourage all those engaged in
        related activities to become familiar with it. Every attempt has been
        made to make the document as readable and usable as possible while still
        retaining the accuracy and clarity needed in a technical specification.</p>
      <p>Readers of this document are expected to be familiar with some
        fundamental concepts of the architecture of the Web [[WEBARCH]], such as
        resources and URIs, as well as a number of data formats. The normative
        element of each Best Practice is the <em>intended outcome</em>.
        Possible implementations are suggested and, where appropriate, these
        recommend the use of a particular technology.
        A basic knowledge of vocabularies and data models would be helpful to
        better understand some aspects of this document. </p>
    </section>
    <section id="scope" class="informative">
      <h2>Scope</h2>
      <p>This document is concerned solely with Best Practices that:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>are specifically relevant to data published on the Web;</li>
        <li>encourage publication or reuse of data on the Web;</li>
        <li>can be tested by machines, humans or a combination of the two.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>As noted above, whether a Best Practice has or has not been followed
        should be judged against the <em>intended outcome</em>, not the <em>possible
          approach to implementation</em> which is offered as guidance. A best
        practice is always subject to improvement as we learn and evolve the Web
        together.</p>

    <section id="context" class="informative">
      <h2>Context</h2>
      <p>The following diagram illustrates the context considered in this document. In general, the Best Practices proposed for publication and usage of
        Data on the Web refer to <a href="#dataset">datasets</a> and <a href="#distribution">
          distributions</a>. Data is published in different distributions, which are specific physical form of a dataset. By data, "we mean known facts
        that can be recorded and that have implicit meaning" [[Navathe]]. These
        distributions facilitate the sharing of data on a large scale, which
        allows datasets to be used for several groups of <a href="#data_consumer">
        data consumers </a>, without regard to purpose, audience, interest,
        or license. Given this heterogeneity and the fact that data publishers
        and data consumers may be unknown to each other, it is necessary to
        provide some information about the datasets and distributions that may also contribute to
        trustworthiness and reuse, such as: structural metadata, descriptive
        metadata, access information, data quality information, provenance
        information, license information and usage information. </p>
      <p>An important aspect of publishing and sharing data on the Web
        concerns the architectural basis of the Web [[WEBARCH]].
        A relevant aspect of this is the identification principle that says that URIs
        should be used to identify resources. In our context, a resource may be
        a whole dataset or a specific item of given dataset. All resources
        should be published with stable URIs, so that they can be referenced and
        make links, via URIs, between two or more resources. Finally, to promote the interoperability among datasets it is important to adopt data vocabularies and standards. </p>
      <!--<p>The following is a composite diagram illustrating the anatomy of a published and acessible Web dataset. Data values correspond to the data itself and may be available in one or more distributions, which should be defined by the publisher considering data consumer's expectations. The Metadata component corresponds to the additional information that describes the dataset and dataset distributions, helping consumers manipulate and reuse the data. In order to allow easy access to the dataset and its corresponding distributions, multiple dataset access mechanisms can  be available. Finally, to promote the interoperability among datasets it is important to adopt data vocabularies and standards.  </p>-->

      <h2>The Best Practices</h2>
      <p>This section contains the Best Practices to be used by data publishers in order to help them and data consumers to overcome the different challenges faced when publishing and consuming data on the Web. One or more Best Practices were proposed for each one of the challenges, which are described in the section <a href="#challenges">Data on the Web Challenges</a>.</p>
      <p>Each BP is related to one or more requirements from the Data on the Web Best Practices Use Cases &amp; Requirements document [[DWBP-UCR]] which guided their development. Each Best Practice has at least one of these requirements as evidence of its relevance.</p>
      <section id="basicExample">
        <h3>Running Example</h3>
          <div class="example" style="counter-increment:none">John works for the Transport Agency of MyCity and is in charge of publishing data about public transport. John wants to publish this data for different types of data consumers such as developers interested on creating applications and also for software agents. It is important that both humans and software agents can easily understand and process the data which should be kept up to date and be easily discoverable on the Web. </div>
          <p>RDF examples of the application of some Best Practices are shown using Turtle [[Turtle]].</p>
      </section>
      
      <section id="metadata">
        <h3>Metadata</h3>
        <p>The Web is an open information space, where the absence of a specific
          context, such a company's internal information system, means that the
          provision of metadata is a fundamental requirement. Data will not be
          discoverable or reusable by anyone other than the publisher if
          insufficient metadata is provided. Metadata provides additional
          information that helps data consumers better understand the meaning of
          data, its structure, and to clarify other issues, such as rights and
          license terms, the organization that generated the data, data quality,
          data access methods and the update schedule of datasets. Publishers are encouraged to provide human-readable information in multiple languages, and, as much as possible, provide the information in the language(s) that the intended users will understand. </p>
        <p>Metadata can be used to help tasks such as dataset discovery and reuse,
        and can be assigned considering different levels of granularity from a
        single property of a resource to a whole dataset, or all datasets from a
        specific organization. Metadata can also be of different types. These types can be classified in
          different taxonomies, with different grouping criteria. For example, a
          specific taxonomy could define three metadata types according to
          descriptive, structural and administrative features. A different taxonomy could define
          metadata types with a scheme according to tasks where metadata are
          used, for example, discovery and reuse.</p>

          <section class="axioms">
            <h4 class="subhead">Why</h4>
            <p>Providing metadata is a fundamental requirement when publishing
              data on the Web because data publishers and data consumers may be
              unknown to each other. Then, it is essential to provide information
              that helps human users and computer applications to understand the
              data as well as other important aspects that describes a dataset
              or a distribution.</p>
          </section>
          <section class="outcome">
            <h4 class="subhead">Intended Outcome</h4>
            <p>Humans will be able to understand the metadata and computer applications, notably user agents, will be able to process it.</p>
          </section>
          <section class="how">
            <h4 class="subhead">Possible Approach to Implementation</h4>
            <p>Possible approaches to provide <em>human readable metadata:</em></p>
            <ul>
              <li>to provide metadata as part of an HTML Web page</li>
              <li>to provide metadata as a separate text file</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Possible approaches to provide <em>machine-readable metadata:</em></p>
            <ul>
              <li> machine-readable metadata may be provided in a serialization
                format such as Turtle and JSON, or it can be embedded in the
                HTML page using [[HTML-RDFA]] or [[JSON-LD]]. If multiple formats are published separately, they should be served from the same URL using <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/Negotiation">content negotiation</a> and made available under separate URIs, distinguished by filename extension. Maintenance of multiple formats is best achieved by generating each available format on the fly based on a single source of the metadata.</li>
              <li> when defining machine-readable metadata, reusing existing
                standard terms and popular vocabularies are strongly
                recommended. For example, Dublin Core Metadata (DCMI) terms
                [[DCTERMS]] and Data Catalog Vocabulary [[VOCAB-DCAT]] can
                be used to provide descriptive metadata. Such vocabularies are designed to be very flexible so it is often helpful to use a specific <em>profile</em> of a vocabulary such as the European Commission's <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/asset/dcat_application_profile/description">DCAT-AP</a></li>

              <li> The <strong>spatial coverage </strong> of the dataset.</li>

            </ul>


            <!-- <p> The information above should be included both in the human

            <p>Descriptive metadata can include the following overall features
              of a distribution:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The <strong>title</strong> and a <strong>description</strong>
                of the distribution.</li>

            <p>The machine-readable version of the descriptive metadata can be
              provided using the vocabulary recommended by W3C to
              describe datasets, i.e. the Data Catalog Vocabulary
              [[VOCAB-DCAT]]. This provides a framework in which datasets can be
              described as abstract entities. </p>

              <p>The example below shows how to use [[VOCAB-DCAT]] to provide
                the machine-readable <strong> discovery </strong> metadata for
                the bus stops dataset (<code>stops-2015-05-05</code>). The dataset has one CSV
                distribution (<code>stops-2015-05-05.csv</code>) that is also described using
                the [[VOCAB-DCAT]].
The dataset is classified under
                the domain represented by the relative URI <code>mobility</code>. This
                domain may be defined as part of a set of domains identified by
                the URI <code>themes</code>. 
                  To describe both concepts and schema
                concepts, John used <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/skos-primer/">SKOS </a>.
                To express frequency of update an instance from the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-data-cube/#dsd-cog">Content-Oriented
                  Guidelines</a> developed as part of the <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr>
                Data Cube Vocabulary efforts was used. John chose to describe
                the spatial and temporal coverage of the example dataset using
                URIs from <a href="http://www.geonames.org/">Geonames</a> and the <a

        <h3>Data Provenance</h3>
        <!--<p><a href="#data_provenance">Data provenance</a> becomes particularly
          important when data is shared between collaborators who might not have
          direct contact with one another either due to proximity or because the

          organizations.</p> -->
        <p>The Web brings together business, engineering, and scientific
          communities creating collaborative opportunities that were previously
          unimaginable. The challenge in publishing data on the Web is providing
          an appropriate level of detail about its origin. The <a href="#data_producer">
          data producer</a> may not necessarily be the data provider and so
          collecting and conveying this corresponding metadata is particularly
          important. Without <a href="#data_provenance">provenance</a>, consumers have no inherent way to trust
          the integrity and credibility of the data being shared. Data

        <p>The quality of a dataset can have a big impact on the quality of applications that use it. As a consequence, the inclusion of <a href="#data_quality">data quality</a> information in data publishing and consumption pipelines is of primary importance. Usually, the assessment of quality involves different kinds of quality dimensions, each representing groups of characteristics that are relevant to publishers and consumers. The Data Quality Vocabulary defines concepts such as measures and metrics to assess the quality for each quality dimension [[VOCAB-DQV]]. There are heuristics designed to fit specific assessment situations that rely on quality indicators, namely, pieces of data content, pieces of data meta-information, and human ratings that give indications about the suitability of data for some intended use.</p>

        <h3>Data Versioning</h3>
        <p>Datasets published on the Web may change over time. Some datasets
          are updated on a scheduled basis, and other datasets are changed as
          improvements in collecting the data make updates worthwhile. In order
          to deal with these changes, new versions of a dataset may be created.
          Unfortunately, there is no consensus about when changes to a dataset should 
          cause it to be considered a different dataset altogether rather than a new version. 
          In the following, we present some scenarios where most publishers would agree that
          the revision should be considered a new version of the existing dataset. </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Scenario 1: a new bus stop is created and it should be added to the dataset;</li>
          <li>Scenario 2: an existing bus stop is removed and it
            should be deleted from the dataset;</li>
          <li>Scenario 3: an error was identified in one of the existing
            bus stops stored in the dataset and this error must be corrected.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In general, multiple datasets that represent time series or
          spatial series, e.g. the same kind of data for different regions
          or for different years, are not considered multiple versions of the same
          dataset. In this case, each dataset covers a different set of observations
          about the world and should be treated as a new dataset. This is also the case with a dataset that
          collects data about weekly weather forecasts for a given city, where
          every week a new dataset is created to store data about that
          specific week. </p>
        <p>Scenarios 1 and 2 might trigger a major version, whereas Scenario 3 would likely trigger only a minor version.
          But how you decide whether versions are minor or major is less important than that you avoid making
          changes without incrementing the version indicator. Even for small changes, it is important to keep track of the
          different dataset versions to make the dataset trustworthy. Publishers
          should remember that a given dataset may be in use by one or more
          data consumers, and they should take reasonable steps to inform those consumers when a new version is released.
          For real-time data, an automated timestamp can serve as a version identifier. 
          For each dataset, the publisher should take a
          consistent, informative approach to versioning, so data consumers can
          understand and work with the changing data. </p>

            <h4 class="subhead">Why</h4>
            <p>Version information makes a revision of a dataset uniquely identifiable.
              Uniqueness can be used by data consumers to determine whether and how data has
              changed over time and to determine specifically which version of a
              dataset they are working with. Good data versioning enables
              consumers to understand if a newer version of a dataset is
              available. Explicit versioning allows for repeatability in
              research, enables comparisons, and prevents confusion. Using
              unique version numbers that follow a standardized approach can
              also set consumer expectations about how the versions differ.</p>

            <p>The best method for providing versioning information
              will vary according to the context; however, there are some basic
              guidelines that can be followed, for example: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Include a unique version number or date as part of the metadata for
                the dataset. </li>
              <li>Use a consistent numbering scheme with a meaningful approach
                to incrementing digits, such as [[SchemaVer]]. </li>
              <!-- <li>Provide a description of what has changed since the previous
                version. </li> -->
              <li>If the data is made available through an API, the URI used to
                request the latest version of the data should not change as the
                versions change, but it should be possible to request a specific
                version through the API.
                <!--See <a href="#VersioningVocabularies">Vocabulary
                  versioning</a> for more on assigning stable URIs for the 'latest version' and for each snapshot.</p> -->
              </li>
              <li>Use Memento [[RFC7089]], or components thereof, to
                express temporal versioning of a dataset and to access the
                version that was operational at a given datetime. The Memento
                protocol aligns closely with the approach for assigning URIs to

        <h3>Data Identifiers</h3>
        <p>Identifiers take many forms and are used extensively in every
          information system. Data discovery, usage and citation on the Web
          depends fundamentally on the use of HTTP (or HTTPS) URIs: globally
          unique identifiers that can be looked up by dereferencing them over
          the Internet [[RFC3986]]. It is perhaps worth emphasizing some key
          points about URIs in the current context.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>URIs are 'dumb strings', that is, they carry no semantics. Their
            function is purely to identify a resource.</li>
          <li>Although the previous point is accurate, it would be perverse for
            a URI such as http://example.com/dataset.csv to return anything
            other than a CSV file. Human readability is helpful.</li>
          <li>When de-referenced (looked up), a single URI may offer the same
            resource in more than one format. http://example.com/dataset may
            offer the same data in, say, CSV, JSON and XML. The server returns
            the most appropriate format based on <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/Negotiation">
              content negotiation </a>.</li>
          <li>One URI may redirect to another.</li>
          <li>De-referencing a URI triggers a computer program to run on a server that may do something as simple as return a single, static file, or it may carry out complex processing. Precisely what processing is carried out, i.e. the software on the server, is completely independent of the URI itself.</li>
        </ol>

            <h4 class="subhead">Why</h4>
            <p>Adopting a common identification system enables basic data
              identification and comparison processes by any stakeholder in a
              reliable way. They are an essential pre-condition for proper data
              management and reuse.</p>
            <p>Developers may build URIs into their code and so it is important 
            that those URIs persist and that they dereference to the same 
            resource over time without the need for human intervention.</p>

            <h4 class="subhead">Intended Outcome</h4>

          <section class="how">
            <h4 class="subhead">Possible Approach to Implementation</h4>
            <p>To be persistent, URIs must be designed as such. A lot has been 
            written on this topic, see, for example, the European Commission's
            Study on Persistent URIs [[PURI]] which in turn links to many other 
            resources.</p>
            <p>Where a data publisher is unable or unwilling to manage a URI
              space directly for persistence, an alternative approach is to use
              a redirection service such as 
              <a href="https://w3id.org/">Permanent Identifiers for the Web</a> 
              or <a href="http://purl.org/">purl.org</a>.
              These provide persistent URIs that can be redirected as required
              so that the eventual location can be ephemeral. The <a href="http://www.purlz.org/">software
              behind such services </a> is freely available so that it can be
              installed and managed locally if required.</p>
            <p>Digital Object Identifiers (<a href="http://www.doi.org/">DOI</a>s)
              offer a similar alternative. These identifiers are defined
              independently of any Web technology but can be appended to a 'URI
              stub.' DOIs are an important part of the digital infrastructure
              for research data and and libraries. </p>
            <aside class="example">
              <p>The URI <code>http://data.mycity.example.com/transport/dataset/bus/stops</code>
                has several features that support persistence:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>All names are subject to change over time but in choosing a
                  domain name, it is reasonable for John to assume that MyCity
                  will continue to exist and that it will continue to have a
                  government. Therefore, while cases like Yugoslavia prove that
                  even country names change and top level domains disappear
                  (like .yu), a domain name based on the city's name is as persistent as any
                  domain name can be.</li>
                <li>By putting data on the <code>data.mycity.example.com</code>
                  subdomain, John is creating a specific domain that can be
                  managed independently of any particular department.</li>
                <li>It is <em>not</em> safe to assume that a specific <em>department</em>
                  will persist. The authorities in MyCity might very well decide
                  that the Transport Agency should be merged with another to
                  create the Transport and Environment Agency. It is right,
                  therefore, not to include the name of the Transport Agency in
                  the URI, but to include the task from which the data comes, in
                  this case that of providing public transport.</li>
                <li>The <code>/dataset</code> path segment is an indication
                  that the URI identifies a dataset, rather than, say, a
                  specific bus route.</li>
                <li>Likewise, the path segment of <code>/bus</code>
                  take us further towards the specific dataset for which John is
                  responsible.</li> 
                <li>Finally <code>/stops</code> leads us to the dataset
                  concerning bus stops in MyCity.</li>
                <li>In DCAT terms, this would be the identifier for the dataset.
                  Specific distributions of the dataset are likely to be
                  identified by adding the relevant file extension to the URI,
                  such as <code>http://data.mycity.example.com/transport/dataset/bus/stops.csv</code>,
                  <code>http://data.mycity.example.com/transport/dataset/bus/stops.json</code>,
                  <code>http://data.mycity.example.com/transport/dataset/bus/stops.ttl</code>
                  etc.</li>

            <p>The power of the Web lies in the <em>Network effect</em>. The
              first telephone only became useful when the second telephone meant
              there was someone to call; the third telephone made both of them
              more useful yet. Data becomes more valuable if it refers to other
              people's data about the same thing, the same place, the same
              concept, the same event, the same person, and so on. That means
              using the same identifiers across datasets and making sure that
              your identifiers can be referred to by other datasets. When those
              identifiers are HTTP URIs, they can be looked up and more data
              discovered.</p>
              <p>These ideas are at the heart of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/LinkedData.html">5 Stars of Linked Data</a> where one data point links to another, and of <a href="http://dret.github.io/webdata/">Hypermedia</a> where links may be to further data or to services that can act on or relate to the data in some way.</p>

            <p>This is a topic in itself and a general document such as this can
              only include superficial detail.</p>
            <p>Developers know that very often the problem they're trying to
              solve will have already been solved by other people. In the same
              way, if you're looking for a set of identifiers for obvious things
              like countries, currencies, subjects, species, proteins, cities
              and regions, Nobel prize winners and products – someone's done it already. The
              steps described for <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/ld-bp/#how-to-find-existing-vocabularies">discovering
                existing vocabularies</a> [[LD-BP]] can readily be adapted.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>ensure URI sets you use are published by a trusted group or
                organization;</li>
              <li>ensure URI sets have persistent URIs.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you can't find an existing set of identifiers that meet your
              needs then you'll need to create your own, following the patterns
              for URI persistence so that others will add value to your data by
              linking to it.</p>
            <p>URIs can be long. In a dataset of even moderate size, storing
              each URI is likely to be repetitive and obviously wasteful.
              Instead, define locally unique identifiers for each element and
              provide data that allows them to be converted to globally unique
              URIs programmatically. The Metadata Vocabulary for Tabular Data
              [[Tabular-Metadata]] provides mechanisms for doing this within
              tabular data such as CSV files, in particular using <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/tabular-metadata/#uri-template-properties">URI
                template properties</a> such as the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/tabular-metadata/#cell-aboutUrl">about
                URL</a> property.</p>
            <aside class="example">
              <p>The URI given as an example in the previous Best Practice (<code>http://data.mycity.example.com/transport/dataset/bus/stops</code>)
                identifies a dataset. Much of the URI can be reused to identify
                bus stops, routes and the type of bus used on a given service.
                For example, a suitable persistent URI for the 'Airport -
                Bullfrog' route would be:</p>
              <p><code>http://data.mycity.example.com/transport/route/bus/id/AB</code></p>
              <p>This has the same initial structure as for the dataset but
                rather than <code>/dataset</code> it now includes the path
                segment <code>/route</code> so that humans can see that the
                type of thing identified is a bus route. The <code>/id</code>
                segment indicates that the URI identifies something that is not
                an information resource, i.e. something you cannot retrieve over
                the Internet, and <code>/AB</code> is the local identifier for
                the actual bus route. 

                This is consistent with advice from GS1's SmartSearch Implementation Guideline [[GS1]]
                which says that where standard identifiers are used for a product, location etc., 
                it is recommended that the URI includes the type of identifier 
                being used.  For example, if a <abbr title="Global Trade Identification Number">GTIN</abbr> is 
                being used to identify a product then the URI should be of the form: 
                <code>http://data.myproduct.example.com/gtin/05011476100885</code>.

                Dereferencing URIs for non-information resources should result in an
                HTTP 303 redirect to a similar URL such as <code>http://data.mycity.example.com/transport/route/bus/doc/AB</code>
                that <em>describes</em>, i.e. gives information about, the AB
                bus route (note the substitution of <code>/doc</code> for <code>/id</code>).
                Jeni Tennison's work on URLs in Data has more to say on this topic [[URLs-in-data]].</p>
              <p>In offering this advice, it is recognized that URIs can be
                long. In a dataset of even moderate size, storing each URI is
                likely to be repetitive and obviously wasteful. Instead, define
                locally unique identifiers for each element (such as <code>AB</code>
                in this example) and provide data that allows them to be
                converted to globally unique URIs programmatically. The Metadata
                Vocabulary for Tabular Data [[Tabular-Metadata]] provides
                mechanisms for doing this within tabular data such as CSV files,
                in particular using <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/tabular-metadata/#uri-template-properties">URI

            <h4 class="subhead">Possible Approach to Implementation</h4>
            <p>The W3C provides a good example of how to do this. The
              (persistent) URI for this document is
              http://www.w3.org/TR/2015/WD-dwbp-20150224/. That identifier
              points to an immutable snapshot of the document on the day of its
              publication. The URI for the 'latest version' of this document is
              http://www.w3.org/TR/dwbp/ which is an identifier for a series of
              closely related documents that are subject to change over time. At
              the time of publication, these two URIs both resolve to this
              document. However, when the next version of this document is
              published, the 'latest version' URI will be changed to point to
              that, but the dated URI remains unchanged.</p>

<aside class = "example">
<p>Suppose that a new bus stop is created. To keep <code>stops-2015-05-05 </code> up to date, a new version of the dataset (<code>stops-2015-12-17</code>) is created. <code>stops-2015-12-17 </code> includes all the data from <code>stops-2015-05-05 </code> plus the data about the new bus stop. The two versions can be identified by the following URIs: </p>
<p><code>http://data.mycity.example.com/transport/dataset/bus/stops-2015-05-05</code> is the versioned URI of the first version of the dataset</p>
<p><code>http://data.mycity.example.com/transport/dataset/bus/stops-2015-12-17</code> is the version URI of the updated version of the dataset</p>
<p><code>http://data.mycity.example.com/transport/dataset/bus/stops</code> always resolves to the latest version so it resolved to <code>stops-2015-05-05</code> <em>until</em> 17 December 2015 when the server configuration was updated to point that URL to <code>stops-2015-12-17</code>.</p>

        <h3>Data Formats</h3>
        <p>The format in which data is made available to consumers is a key
          aspect of making that data usable. The best, most flexible access
          mechanism in the world is pointless unless it serves data in formats
          that enable use and reuse. Below we detail Best Practices in selecting
          formats for your data, both at the level of files and that of
          individual fields. W3C encourages use of formats that can be used by
          the widest possible audience and processed most readily by computing
          systems. Source formats, such as database dumps or spreadsheets, used
          to generate the final published format, are out of scope. This
          document is concerned with what is actually published rather than
          internal systems used to generate the published data.</p>

          <section class="axioms">
            <h4 class="subhead">Why</h4>
            <p>As data becomes more ubiquitous, and datasets become larger and
              more complex, processing by computers becomes ever more crucial. 
              Posting data in a format that is not <a href= "#machine_readable">machine-readable</a> places
              severe limitations on the continuing usefulness of the data. Data
              becomes useful when it has been processed and transformed into
              information. Note that there is an important distinction between formats that can be read and edited by humans using a computer and formats that are machine-readable. The latter term implies that the data is readily extracted, transformed and processed by a computer. </p>
            <p>Using non-standard data formats is costly and inefficient, and
              the data may lose meaning as it is transformed. On the other hand,
              standardized data formats enable interoperability as well as
              future uses, such as remixing or visualization, many of which
              cannot be anticipated when the data is first published. It is also important to note that most machine-readable standardized formats are also locale-neutral.</p>

            <p>Data values that are machine-readable and not specific to any particular language or culture are more durable and less open to misinterpretation than values that use one of the many different cultural representations. Things like dates, currencies and numbers may look similar but have different meanings in different locales. For example, the 'date' 4/7 can be read as 7th of April or the 4th of July depending on where the data was created. Similarly, €2,000 is either two thousand Euros or an over-precise representation of two Euros. By using a locale-neutral format, systems avoid the need to establish specific interchange rules that vary according to the language or location of the user. When the data is already in a locale-specific format, making the locale and language explicit by providing <a href="#locale_parameter">locale</a> parameters allows users to determine how readily they can work with the data and may enable automated translation services.</p>

<p>Most common data serialization formats are locale-neutral. For example, XML Schema types such as <code>xsd:integer</code> and <code>xsd:date</code> are intended for locale-neutral data interchange. Using locale-neutral representations allows the data values to be processed accurately without complex parsing or misinterpretation and also allows the data to be presented in the format most comfortable for the consumer of the data in any locale.  For example, rather than storing "€2000,00" as a string, it's strongly preferred to exchange a data structure such as:</p>

<pre>&hellip;
"price" {
    "value": 2000.00,
    "currency": "EUR"
}
&hellip;</pre>
<p>Some datasets contain values that are not or cannot be rendered into a locale-neutral format. This is particularly true of any natural language text values. For each data field that can contain locale-affected or natural-language text, there should be an associated language tag used to indicate the language and locale of the data. This locale information can be used in parsing the data or to ensure proper presentation and processing of the value by the consumer. <abbr title="Best Current Practice">BCP</abbr>47 [[BCP47]] provides the standard for language and locale identification and, informatively, <abbr title="Unicode Common Locale Data Repository">CLDR</abbr> [[CLDR]] is the source for both representing specific localized formats and as a reference for specific locale data values.</p>

        <h3>Data Vocabularies</h3>
        <p><a href="http://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/ontology">Vocabularies</a>
          define the concepts and relationships (also referred to as “terms” or
          “attributes”) used to describe and represent an area of interest.
          They are used to classify the terms that can be used in a
          particular application, characterize possible relationships, and
          define possible constraints on using those terms. Several near-synonyms
          for 'vocabulary' have been coined, for example, ontology, controlled
          vocabulary, thesaurus, taxonomy, code list, semantic network.</p>
<!--        <p>Data is often represented in a structured and controlled way, making
          use of one or more vocabularies to provide, for example, the types
          of nodes and links in a data graph or the types of values for columns in a
          table. A vocabulary for describing books may include the term 'subject' rather than 'topic', one describing people may include the relationship “knows”
          between two persons and so on. Additionally, the values used may come from a
          limited set of pre-existing values or resources: for example object
          types, roles of a person, countries in a geographic area, or possible
          subjects for books. Such vocabularies ensure a level of control,
          standardization and interoperability in the data, and they can also serve
          to improve the usability of datasets. If a vocabulary defines a
          concept described in several languages, then the use of that vocabulary
          allows applications to localize their application more easily than otherwise.</p> -->
        <p>There is no strict division between the artifacts referred to by
          these names. “Ontology” tends however to denote the vocabularies of
          classes and properties that structure the descriptions of resources in
          (linked) datasets. In relational databases, these correspond to the
          names of tables and columns; in XML, they correspond to the elements
          defined by an XML Schema. Ontologies are the key building blocks for
          inference techniques on the Semantic Web. The first means offered by
          W3C for creating ontologies is the RDF Schema [[RDF-SCHEMA]] language.
          It is possible to define more expressive ontologies with additional
          axioms using languages such as those in The Web Ontology Language
          [[OWL2-OVERVIEW]]. </p>
        <p>On the other hand, “controlled vocabularies”, “concept schemes” and
          “knowledge organization systems” enumerate and define resources that
          can be employed in the descriptions made with the former kind of
          vocabulary, i.e. vocabularies that structure the descriptions of resources in
          (linked) datasets. A concept from a thesaurus, say, “architecture”, will for
          example be used in the subject field for a book description (where
          “subject” has been defined in an ontology for books). For defining the
          terms in these vocabularies, complex formalisms are most often not
          needed. Simpler models have thus been proposed to represent and
          exchange them, such as the ISO 25964 data model [[ISO-25964]] or W3C's
          Simple Knowledge Organization System [[SKOS-PRIMER]].</p>

          <section class="axioms">
            <h4 class="subhead">Why</h4>
            <p>Use of vocabularies already in use by others captures and facilitates consensus in communities. 
              It increases interoperability and reduces
              redundancies, thereby encouraging reuse of your own data. In particular, the
              use of shared vocabularies for metadata (especially structural, provenance, quality
              and versioning metadata) helps the comparison and automatic processing of both data and metadata. In addition, referring to codes and terms from standards helps to avoid ambiguity and clashes between similar elements or values.</p>

            <h4 class="subhead">Possible Approach to Implementation</h4>
            <p>The <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/ld-bp/#VOCABULARIES">Vocabularies</a> section of the <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr> Best Practices for Publishing Linked Data [[LD-BP]] provides guidance on the discovery, evaluation and selection of existing vocabularies.</p>
            <p>Organizations such as the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC), 
            <abbr title="International Standards Organization">ISO</abbr>, W3C,
            <abbr title="World Meteorological Organization">WMO</abbr>, libraries and research data services, etc.
            provide lists of codes, terminologies and Linked Data vocabularies that can be used by everyone.
            A key point is to make sure the dataset, or its documentation, provides enough (human- and machine-readable) context
              so that data consumers can retrieve and exploit the standardized meaning of the values. In the context of the Web, using unambiguous, Web-based identifiers (URIs) for standardized vocabulary resources
              is an efficient way to do this, noting that the same URI may have multilingual labels attached for greater cross-border interoperability.</p>
            <aside class="example"><ol>
	    <!--<li>All examples in this document show how common vocabularies (PROV, SKOS, etc) can be reused
              to express data and metadata statements, instead of minting entirely new classes and properties.</li>-->
              <li>The DCAT vocabulary expresses metadata concerning datasets [[VOCAB-DCAT]] and
              re-uses elements from several pre-existing vocabularies: Dublin Core, FOAF, SKOS and vCard.
              Reusing Dublin Core properties like <code>dct:title</code> instead of
              creating new ones (say, <code>dcat:title</code>) enables DCAT-based metadata
              to be consumed by any application that can read and manipulate Dublin Core statements.</li>
              <li>In the digital culture sector, the data model for 
              <a href="http://europeana.eu">Europeana</a> (<a href="http://pro.europeana.eu/page/edm-documentation">EDM</a>)
              also makes extensive uses of existing shared vocabularies like Dublin Core, FOAF, SKOS, etc.
              This has facilitated adoption of EDM by Europeana's data providers and helped
              position it as a Best Practice for similar initiatives in the same sector.
              For instance, the <a href="http://dp.la/info/developers/map/">metadata application profile</a> from the
              <a href="http://dp.la">Digital Public Library of America</a> reuses EDM and thus
              the various vocabularies that EDM builds on. As a result, large amounts of
              digital culture data have become more interoperable within the sector. That data is
              also easier to reuse by consumers from other communities, who are not familiar
              with the traditional models and terminologies used by library, archives and museums.</li>

              a format for publishing public transportation data. This format relies on a set of fields like <code>route_short_name</code> or
              <code>route_type</code> that are carefully defined
              and exposed to constant community feedback in order to facilitate consensus.
              Definitions include specifications of coded values, as the ones used with <code>route_type</code>:<br />

        <section class="axioms">
          <h4 class="subhead">Why</h4>
          <p>As Albert Einstein may or may not have said: everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler.</p>
          <p>Formal semantics help to establish precise specifications
            that convey detailed meaning and using a complex vocabulary (ontology)
            may serve as a basis for tasks such as automated reasoning. On the other
            hand, such complex vocabularies require more effort to produce and
            understand, which could hamper their reuse,
            comparison and linking of datasets that use them.</p>
          <p>If the data is sufficiently rich to support detailed research questions (the fact that A, B and C are true, and that D is not true, leads to the conclusion E) then something like an OWL Profile would clearly be appropriate [[OWL2-PROFILES]].</p>
          <p>But there is nothing complicated about a list of bus stops.</p>
          <p>Choosing a very simple vocabulary is always attractive but there is a danger: the drive for simplicity might lead the publisher to omit some data that provides important information, such as the geographical location of the bus stops that would prevent showing them on a map. Therefore, a balance has to be struck, remembering that the goal is not simply to share your data, but for others to reuse it.</p>
<!--
Highly
            formalized data is also harder to exploit by inference engines: for
            example, using an OWL class in a position where a SKOS concept is
            enough, or using OWL classes with complex OWL axioms raises the
            formal complexity of the data according to the OWL Profiles
            [[OWL2-PROFILES]]. Data producers should therefore seek to identify
            the right level of formalization for particular domains, audiences
            and tasks, and maybe offer different formalization levels when one
            size does not fit all.</p>-->

          <h4 class="subhead">Possible Approach to Implementation</h4>
          <p>Look at what your peers do already. It's likely you'll see that there is a commonly used vocabulary that matches, or nearly matches, your current needs. That's probably the one to use.</p>
          <p>You may find a vocabulary that you'd like to use but you notice a semantic constraint that makes it difficult to do so, such as a domain or range restriction that doesn't apply to your case. In that scenario, it's often worth contacting the vocabulary publisher and talking to them about it. They may well be able to lift that restriction and provide further guidance on how the vocabulary is used more broadly.</p>
        <p>W3C operates a mailing list at <a href="mailto:public-vocabs@w3.org">public-vocabs@w3.org</a> [<a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-dwbp-vocabs/">archive</a>] where issues around vocabulary usage and development can be discussed.</p>
<p>If you are creating a vocabulary of your own, keep the semantic restrictions to the minimum that works for you, again, so as to increase the possibility of reuse by others. As an example, the designers of the (very widely used) SKOS ontology itself have minimized its ontological commitment by questioning
            all formal axioms that were suggested for its classes and properties. Often they were rejected
            because their use, while beneficial to many applications, would have created
            formal inconsistencies for the data from other applications, making SKOS not usable at all
            for these. As an example, the property <code>skos:broader</code> was not defined
            as a transitive property, even though it would have fitted the way hierarchical links between concepts
            are created for many thesauri [[SKOS-DESIGN]]. Look for evidence of that kind of "design for wide use" when selecting a vocabulary.</p>

<p>Another example of this "design for wide use" can be seen in <a href="http://schema.org">schema.org</a>. Launched in June 2011, schema.org was massively adopted in a very short time in part because of its informative rather than normative approach for defining the types of objects that properties can be used with. For instance, the values of the property <a href="http://schema.org/author"><code>author</code></a> are only "expected" to be of type <code>Organization</code> or <code>Person</code>. <code>author</code> "can be used" on the type <code>CreativeWork</code> but this is not a strict constraint. Again, that approach to design makes schema.org a good choice as a vocabulary to use when encoding data for sharing.</p>

<!--
          <p>Identify the "role" played by the vocabulary for the datasets, say,
            providing classes and properties used to type resources and provide
            the predicates for RDF statements, or elements in an XML Schema, as
            opposed to providing simple concepts or codes that are used for
            representing attributes of the resources described in a dataset.
            When simpler data models are enough to convey the necessary semantics,
            represent vocabularies using them.</p>
          <p>Even when a language with rich formal semantics like OWL is used to
            express a vocabulary, it is preferable that this vocabulary has a minimal
            <em>ontological commitment</em>, i.e. by featuring only the formal axioms
            that enable inferences and validation checks
            that have been explicitly identified as relevant for the domain or application at hand.
            The more axioms are used to specify a vocabulary, the narrower its usage is;
            unnecessary axioms unnecessarily constrain the reuse of a vocabulary
            across applications.</p> -->
          <aside class="example"><!--<ol>
          <li>For expressing simple vocabularies like thesauri or code lists as Linked Data,
            a simpler data model like SKOS may be preferred over formal
            ontology languages like OWL; see for example how <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-data-cube/#schemes">concept
              schemes and code lists</a> are represented and used in the RDF Data Cube
            Recommendation [[VOCAB-DATA-CUBE]].</li>
          <li>The Data Quality [[VOCAB-DQV]] and Dataset Usage vocabularies [[VOCAB-DUV]] created by the W3C Working
            Group publishing this document have also sought to minimize the number of formal
            axioms involved in their definition. For instance, the property <code>dqv:hasQualityMeasurement</code>
            has no formal domain in the RDFS/OWL sense, even though it is expected to be most often used with
            resources that are of type <code>dcat:Dataset</code> or <code>dcat:Distribution</code>.
            This allows application designers to employ it for other types of entities, for which
            quality measurements would also be relevant but that were not in the focus of
            the design process for DQV.</li>

      <h3>Sensitive Data</h3>
      <p>To support Best Practices for publishing sensitive data, data
        publishers should identify all sensitive data, assess the exposure risk,
        determine the intended usage, data user audience and any related usage
        policies, obtain appropriate approval, and determine the appropriate
        security measures needed to be taken to protect the data, which should also
        account for secure authentication and use of HTTPS.</p>
      <p>Data publishers should preserve the privacy of individuals where the
        release of personal information would endanger safety (unintended
        accidents) or security (deliberate attack). Privacy information might
        include: full name, home address, mail address, national identification
        number, IP address (in some cases), vehicle registration plate number,
        driver's license number, face, fingerprints, or handwriting, credit card
        numbers, digital identity, date of birth, birthplace, genetic
        information, telephone number, login name, screen name, nickname, health
        records etc.</p>
      <p> At times, because of sharing policies, sensitive data may not be
        available in part or in its entirety. Data unavailability represents
        gaps that may affect the overall analysis of datasets. To account for
        unavailable data, data publishers should publish information about
        unavoidable data gaps.</p> -->

    <!-- end of Data Sensitive -->
    <!-- begin of Data Access -->
    <section id="dataAccess">
      <h3>Data Access</h3>
      <p>Providing easy access to data on the Web enables both humans and machines to take advantage of the benefits of sharing data using the Web infrastructure. By default, the Web offers access using Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) methods. This provides access to data at an atomic transaction level. This might be through the simple bulk download of a file or, where data is distributed across multiple files or requires more sophisticated retrieval methods, through an API. The two basic methods, bulk download and <abbr title="Application Programming Interfaces">API</abbr>, are not mutually exclusive. 

      <p>In the bulk download approach, data is
        generally pre-processed server side where multiple files or directory
        trees of files are provided as one downloadable file. When bulk data is
        being retrieved from non-file system solutions, depending on the data
        user communities, the data publisher can offer APIs to support a series
        of retrieval operations representing a single transaction.</p>
      <p> For data that is generated in real time or near real time, data publishers should use an automated system to enable immediate access to time-sensitive data, such as emergency information, weather forecasting data, or system monitoring metrics. In general, APIs should be available to allow third parties to automatically search and retrieve such data.</p> 
      <p> Aside from helping to automate real-time data pipelines, APIs are suitable for all kinds of data on the Web. Though they generally require more work than posting files for download, publishers are increasingly finding that delivering a well documented, standards-based, stable API is worth the effort.</p> 
      <p>For some data publishers, it is important to know who has downloaded the data and how they have used it. There are two possible approaches to gathering this information. First, publishers can <em>invite</em> users to provide it, the user's motivation for doing so being that it encourages the continued publication of the data and promotes their own work. A second and less user-friendly approach is to require registration before data is accessed. In both cases, the Dataset Usage Vocabulary [[VOCAB-DUV]] provides a structure for representing such information. When collecting data from users, the publisher should explain why and how information gathered from users (either explicitly or implicitly) will be used. Without a clear policy users might be fearful of providing information and thus the value of the dataset is reduced.</p>
      <!--p>On a further note, it can be observed that data on the Web is
        essentially about the description of entities identified by a unique,
        Web-based, identifier (an URI). Once the data is dumped and sent to an
        institute specialised in digital preservation the link with the Web is
        broken (dereferencing) but the role of the URI as a unique identifier
        still remains. In order to increase the usability of preserved dataset
        dumps it is relevant to maintain a list of these identifiers. </p-->

          <h4 class="subhead">Why</h4>
          <p>When Web data is distributed across many URIs but might logically
            be organized as one container, accessing the data in bulk can be useful.
            Bulk access provides a consistent means to handle the data as one
            dataset. Individually accessing data over many retrievals can be cumbersome
            and, if used to reassemble the complete dataset, can lead to inconsistent approaches to handling the data.</p>

          <h4 class="subhead">Possible Approach to Implementation</h4>
          <p>Depending on the nature of the data and consumer needs, possible

          <ul>
            <li>For datasets that exist initially as multiple files, preprocessing a copy of the data into a single file and making the data accessible for download from one URI. For larger datasets, the file can also be compressed.</li>
            <li>Hosting an API that includes the ability to
              retrieve a bulk download in addition to dynamic queries. This
              approach is useful for capturing a complete snapshot of dynamic data.</li>
            <li>For very large datasets, bulk file transfers can be enabled via means other than http, such as <a href="http://www.slac.stanford.edu/~abh/bbcp/">bbcp</a> or <a href="http://toolkit.globus.org/toolkit/docs/latest-stable/gridftp/">GridFTP</a>.</li>
          </ul>
          <p> The bulk download should include the metadata describing the dataset. Discovery metadata [[VOCAB-DCAT]] should also be available outside the bulk download.</p>

        <section class="axioms">
          <h4 class="subhead">Why</h4>
          <p>Large datasets can be difficult to move from place to place. It can also be inconvenient for users to store or parse a large dataset. Users should not have to download a complete dataset if they only need a subset of it. Moreover, Web applications that tap into large datasets will perform better if their developers can take advantage of “lazy loading”, working with smaller pieces of a whole and pulling in new pieces only as needed. The ability to work with subsets of the data also enables offline processing to work more efficiently. Real-time applications benefit in particular, as they can update more quickly.</p>

        <section class="outcome">
          <h4 class="subhead">Intended Outcome</h4>
          <p>Humans and applications will be able to access subsets of a dataset, rather than the entire thing, with a high ratio of needed to unneeded data for the largest number of users. Static datasets that users in the domain would consider to be too large will be downloadable in smaller pieces. APIs will make slices or filtered subsets of the data available, the granularity depending on the needs of the domain and the demands of performance in a Web application.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="how">
          <h4 class="subhead">Possible Approaches to Implementation</h4>
          <p>Consider the expected use cases for your dataset and determine what types of subsets are likely to be most useful. An API is usually the most flexible approach to serving subsets of data, as it allows customization of what data is transferred, making the available subsets much more likely to provide the needed data &ndash; and little unneeded data &ndash; for any given situation. The granularity should be suitable for Web application access speeds. (An API call that  returns within one second enables an application to deliver interactivity that feels natural. Data that takes more than ten seconds to deliver will likely cause users to suspect failure.)</p>
          <p>Another way to subset a dataset is to simply split it into smaller units and make those units individually available for download or viewing.</p>
          <p>It can also be helpful to mark up a dataset so that individual sections through the data (or even smaller pieces, if expected use cases warrant it) can be processed separately. One way to do that is by indicating “slices” with the <a href="/TR/vocab-data-cube/#cubes-slices">RDF Data Cube Vocabulary</a>.</p>

<p> The MyCity transit agency has been collecting detailed data about passenger usage for several years. This is a very large dataset, containing values for numbers of passengers by transit type, route, vehicle, driver, entry stop, exit stop, transit pass type, entry time, etc.  They have found that a wide variety of stakeholders are interested in downloading various subsets of the data. The folks who run each transit system want only the data for their transit mode, the city planners only want the numbers of entries and exits at each stop, the city budget office wants only the numbers for the various types of passes sold, and others want still different subsets. The agency created a Web site where users can select which variables are of interest to them, set ranges on some variables, and download only the subset they need. </p>

            real-time data producers making their data readily available to the
            data publisher. The necessity of providing real-time access for a
            given application will need to be evaluated on a case by case basis
            considering refresh rates, latency introduced by data post
            processing steps, infrastructure availability, and the data needed
            by consumers. In addition to making data accessible, data publishers

          <h4 class="subhead">Possible Approach to Implementation</h4>
          <p>A possible approach to implementation is for publishers to configure a Web Service that provides a connection so as real-time data is received by the web service it can be instantly made available to consumers by polling or streaming. </p>

          <p>If data is checked infrequently by consumers, real-time data can be polled upon consumer request for the most recent data through an API.  The data publishers will provide an API to facilitate these read-only requests.</p>

          <p>If data is checked frequently by consumers, a streaming data implementation may be more appropriate where data is pushed through an API.  While streaming techniques are beyond the scope of this best practice, there are many standard protocols and technologies available (for example Server-sent Events, WebSocket, EventSourceAPI) for clients receiving automatic updates from the server.</p>
          <!--<p>Real-time data accessibility may be achieved through two means: </p>
          <ul>
            <li> Push - as data is produced, it is communicated to
              the data publisher either directly or by storage in a location accessible to the data publisher.</li>
            <li>On-Demand (Pull) - available real-time data is made available
              upon request. In this case, data publishers will provide an API to
              facilitate these read-only requests.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>To engender greater credibility, in addition to data itself, publishers can provide access to
          error conditions, anomalies, and instrument "house keeping" data. This will 
          enhance real-time applications' ability to interpret and convey
          real-time data quality to consumers.</p> -->

          <h4 class="subhead">How to Test</h4>
          To adequately test real time data access, data will need to be tracked
          from the time it is initially collected to the time it is published
          and accessed. [[PROV-O]] can be used to describe these activities.
          Caution should be used when analyzing real-time access for systems
          that consist of multiple computer systems. For example, tests that
          rely on wall clock time stamps may reflect inconsistencies between the
          individual computer systems as opposed to data publication time
          latency.

          <p>New versions of the dataset can be posted to the Web on a regular schedule, following the <a href="#dataVersioning">Best Practices for Data Versioning</a>. Posting to the Web can be made a part of the release process for new versions of the data. Making Web publication a deliverable item in the process and assigning an individual person as responsible for the task can help prevent data becoming out of date. To set consumer expectations for updates going forward, you can include human-readable text stating the expected publication frequency, and you can provide machine-readable metadata indicating the frequency as well. </p>

A new version of the dataset (<code>stops-2016-05-05</code>) is created to reflect the update schedule of the data. It is important to note that new versions can be created sooner than the schedule calls for, but the publisher should ensure that extra versions are published to the Web as quickly as their scheduled counterparts.

For example, using HTTP verbs as methods and URIs that map directly to individual resources helps to avoid tight coupling between requests and responses, making for an API that is easy to maintain and can readily be understood and used by many developers. The statelessness of the Web can be a strength in enabling quick scaling, and using hypermedia enables rich interactions with your API. </p>

            <h4 class="subhead">Possible Approaches to Implementation</h4>
            <p>REST (REpresentational State Transfer)[[Fielding]][[Richardson]] is an architectural style that, when used in a Web API, takes advantage of the architecture of the Web itself. A full discussion of how to build a RESTful API is beyond the scope of this document, but there are many resources and a strong community that can help in getting started. There are also many RESTful development frameworks available. If you are already using a Web development framework that supports building REST APIs, consider using that. If not, consider an API-only framework that uses REST.</p>
            <p>Another aspect of implementation to consider is making a hypermedia API, one that responds with links as well as data. Links are what make the Web a web, and data APIs can be more useful and usable by including links in their responses. The links can offer additional resources, documentation, and navigation. Even for an API that does not meet all the constraints of REST, returning links in responses can make for a service that is rich and self-documenting.</p>
            <!--<p>Complementary references about REST are [[Fielding]] and [[Richardson]].</p>-->
            <aside class="example">An example response for information about a certain bus route from a hypermedia API might look like the following:

<p>A typical API reference provides a comprehensive list of the calls the API can handle, describing the purpose of each one, detailing the parameters it allows and what it returns, and giving one or more examples of its use. One nice trend in API documentation is to provide a form in which developers can enter specific calls for testing, to see what the API returns for their use case. There are now tools available for quickly creating this type of documentation, such as <a href="http://swagger.io/">Swagger</a>, <a href="https://www.mashery.com/api/io-docs">io-docs</a>, <a href="https://openapis.org/">OpenApis</a>, and others. It is important to say that the API should be self-documenting as well, so that calls return helpful information about errors and usage. API users should be able to contact the maintainers with questions, suggestions, or bug reports.</p>
<p> The quality of documentation is also related to usage and feedback from developers. Try to get constant feedback from your users about the documentation. </p>
            <aside class="example">


In order to help developers, the transport agency offers a complete documentation about the API that provides access to data about bus stops and routes. The <a href="./dwbp-api-example.html">API documentation</a> includes a list of the calls handled by the API, the corresponding parameters and some examples. 
             
             <!--<p>Example of an <a href="./dwbp-api-example.html">API documentation</a> page.</p> -->

<li>Use of <code>void:TechnicalFeature</code> to describe the API for a (<a href="/TR/void/#dataset">VoID</a>) Dataset (or subset); providing a set of values, terms or entities for each API parameter (<a href="http://portal.sirf.net/about-sirf">CSIRO's Spatial Identifier Reference Framework</a>). Use URI Templates [[RFC6570]] to bind API parameters to RESTful URLs. A 'short-form' of the identifier may be required for usage in the API; this may be defined as a SKOS notation. </li>
<li>Use of <a href="/TR/vocab-data-cube/#data-cubes">Data Cube</a> with Dimensions to define the data available from a predictably structured dataset - "what, where, when", and so on (ref. <a href="http://portal.sirf.net/about-sirf">CSIRO's Spatial Identifier Reference Framework</a>); each Dimension of the Data Cube is bound to a parameter in the API method. The "where" Dimension of a Data Cube, if specified as <code>qb:CodedProperty</code>, may bound to a set of SpatialThings (e.g. using the property <code>qb:codeList</code>). The URI Set (the set of all SpatialThings mentioned in the Data Cube) provides a 'controlled vocabulary' of locations for which 'observations' (data points) in the Data Cube are available (e.g. air quality data is available at these locations). </li>

          </section>
          <section class="how">
            <h4 class="subhead">Possible Approach to Implementation</h4>
          <p>When improving your API, focus on adding new calls or new options rather than changing how existing calls work. Existing clients can ignore such changes and will continue functioning.</p>
            <p>If using a fully RESTful style, you should be able to avoid changes that affect developers by keeping resource URIs constant and changing only elements that your users do not code to directly. If you need to change your data in ways that are not compatible with the extension points that you initially designed, then a completely new design is called for, and that means changes that break client code. In that case, it’s best to implement the changes as a new REST API, with a different resource URI.</p>
          <p>If using an architectural style that does not allow you to make moderately significant changes without breaking client code, use versioning. Indicate the version in the response header. Version numbers should be reflected in your URIs or in request "accept" headers (using content negotiation). When versioning in URIs, include the version number as far to the left as possible. Keep the previous version available for developers whose code has not yet been adapted to the new version.</p>
          <aside class="example">Some examples of breaking changes to an API include:
            <ul>
              <li>Removing a call;</li>
              <li>Changing the method used to make a call;</li>
              <li>Changing the URI of a resource used in a call;</li>

              <li>Changing the data type of a value in a response, such as changing a string to an array;</li>
            </ul>
<p>Suppose the MyCity transit agency's API responds to a request for a certain bus's arrival time at a single station as <code>http://data.mycity.example.com/transport/api/arrivals/buses/53/stop/12 </code>, but the agency decides it wants to make it possible to query for a range of stops at once. Rather than change the form of the request to require a range, like <code>http://data.mycity.example.com/transport/api/arrivals/buses/53/stop/12-12 </code>, the agency can keep the old API call and add a new one for multiple arrivals, like <code>http://data.mycity.example.com/transport/api/arrivals/buses/53/stops/1-12 </code>.</p>

          <p>To notify users directly of changes, it's a good idea to create a mailing list and encourage developers to join. You can then announce changes there, and this provides a nice mechanism for feedback as well. It also allows your users to help each other.</p>

      <h3>Data Preservation</h3>
      <p>The working group recognizes that it is unrealistic to assume that all data on the Web will be available on demand at all times into the indefinite future. For a wide variety of reasons, data publishers are likely to want or need to remove data from the live Web, at which point it moves out of scope for the current work and into the scope of data archivists. What <em>is</em> in scope here, however, is what is left behind, that is, what steps should publishers take to indicate that data has been removed or archived. Simply deleting a resource from the Web is bad practice. In that circumstance, dereferencing the URI would lead to an HTTP Response code of 404 that tells the user nothing other than that the resource was not found. The following Best Practices offer more productive approaches.</p>


      <!-- begin of resource status BP -->
      <div class="practice">
        <p><span id="ResourceStatus" class="practicelab">Preserve identifiers</span></p>
        <p class="practicedesc">When removing data from the Web, preserve the identifier and provide information about the archived resource.</p>
        <section class="axioms">
          <h4 class="subhead">Why</h4>
          <p>URI dereferencing is the primary interface to data on the Web. If dereferencing a URI leads to the infamous 404 response code (Not Found), the user will not know whether the lack of availability is permanent or temporary, planned or accidental. If the publisher, or a third party, has archived the data, that archived copy is much less likely to be found if the original URI is effectively broken.</p>
  </section>
        <section class="outcome">
          <h4 class="subhead">Intended Outcome</h4>
          <p>The URI of a dataset will always dereference to the dataset or redirect to information about it.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="how">
          <h4 class="subhead">Possible Approach to Implementation</h4>
          <p>There are two scenarios to consider:</p><ol>
            <li>the dataset has been deleted entirely and is no longer available via any route;</li>
            <li>the dataset has been archived and is only available through a request to the archive.</li></ol>
          <p>In the first of these cases, the server should be configured to respond with an HTTP Response code of <a href="https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html#sec10.4.11">410 (Gone)</a>. From the specification:</p>
          <blockquote>The 410 response is primarily intended to assist the task of Web maintenance by notifying the recipient that the resource is intentionally unavailable and that the server owners desire that remote links to that resource be removed.</blockquote>
          <p>In the second case, where data has been archived, it is more appropriate to redirect requests to a Web page giving information about the archive that holds the data and how a potential user can access it.</p>
          <p>In both cases, the original URI continues to identify the dataset and leads to useful information, even though that dataset is no longer directly available.</p>

          <aside class="example" id="archiveExample">
          <p>John decides to archive versions of the bus stop data that have been superseded by more recent versions for at least a year, such as the version from 2012-03-30. The server is configured such that requests for the March 2012 dataset are redirected, using HTTP Code 303, to a Web page that includes the following notice.</p>

<div style="border:thin solid black; padding:0 0.3em; font-family:serif">
<h4 style="margin-top:0.3em">Archived</h4>
<p id="archiveEg">The data you requested has been archived. This is inline with the MyCity policy of archiving data that was superseded more than 12 months ago. However, a copy can be requested at any time via the <a href="#archiveEg">contact page</a>.</p>

          <h4 class="subhead">Why</h4>
          <p>A chunk of Web data is by definition dependent on the rest of the
            global graph. This global context influences the meaning of the
            description of the resources found in the dataset. Ideally, the
            preservation of a particular dataset would involve preserving all
            its context. That is the entire Web of Data. </p>
          <p>At the time of archiving, an evaluation of the linkage of the dataset
            dump to already preserved resources, and the vocabularies used, needs to be assessed. Datasets for
            which very few of the vocabularies used and/or resources pointed to
            are already preserved somewhere should be flagged as being at risk.</p>

          <p>Check whether all the resources used are either already preserved
            somewhere or need to be provided along with the dataset being considered for
            preservation.</p>
          <aside class="example">
            <p>An RDF dataset targeted for preservation is made of the following
              triples:</p>
            <pre class="highlight"> 
  &lt;http://data.mycity.example.com/transport/route/bus/ABtimetable&gt; 
      a gtfs:Route ;
      gtfs:color "ff0000" ;
      gtfs:shortname "10" ;
      gtfs:longName "Airport - Bullfrog" ;
      gtfs:agency &lt;http://data.mycity.example.com/transport-agency/DTA&gt; ;
      gtfs:routeType ex:three ;

      gtfs:longName "Bullfrog - Furnace Creek Resort" ;
      gtfs:agency &lt;http://data.mycity.example.com/transport-agency/DTA&gt; ;
      gtfs:routeType ex:three ;
      ex:usualVehicleType dbpedia:Articulated_bus ;
      foaf:isPrimaryTopicOf ex:Bullfrog_Furnace_Creek_Resort
      .
  …
</pre>
            <p>Those triples make use of the "gtfs" vocabulary and a custom one
              defined in the testing domain name "ex". It also uses entities
              defined in "foaf", "dbpedia" and "ex". Although not formal
              standards, FOAF and GTFS [[GTFS]] are well established ontologies
              that are archived in several places on the Web (see, for instance,
              <a href="http://lov.okfn.org">the LOV repository</a>). Entities
              defined in DBpedia are also preserved through their <a href="http://mementoweb.org/depot/native/dbpedia/">Memento
                gateway</a> and archived dumps of the dataset also exist. The
              risks associated to preserving the triple making use of those
              external resource is thus minimal. A bigger concern arises from
              the usage made of resources defined in "ex" which is a namespace
              that, by design, does not exist outside of the dataset. Unless the
              data describing "ex:usualVehicleType", "ex:Airport_Bullfrog" and
              "ex:Bullfrog_Furnace_Creek_Resort" is preserved alongside those
              triples their contextual meaning will be lost. This is
              particularly critical for "ex:usualVehicleType" as without it the
              relationship between the described route and the dbpedia resources
              will be unknown to a consuming application (however obvious it may
              be to a human).</p>
            <p>Considering this assessment, a revised dataset including the
              definition of "ex:usualVehicleType" can be considered for
              preservation:</p>

            in order to still be usable with more modern software (see
            [[ROSENTHAL]]). This task can be made more challenging, or even

      <h3>Feedback</h3>
      <p>Publishing on the Web enables data sharing on a large scale
        to a wide range of audiences with different levels
        of expertise. Data publishers want to ensure that the data published is
        meeting the data consumer needs and for this purpose, user feedback is crucial. Feedback
        has benefits for both publishers and consumers, helping data
        publishers to improve the integrity of their published data, as well as
        encouraging the publication of new data. Feedback allows data consumers
        to have a voice describing usage experiences (e.g. applications using
        data), preferences and needs. When possible, feedback should also be
        publicly available for other data consumers to examine. Making feedback
        publicly available allows users to become aware of other data consumers,
        supports a collaborative environment, and allows user community
        experiences, concerns or questions are currently being addressed.</p>
      <p>From a user interface perspective there are different ways to gather
        feedback from data consumers, including site registration, contact
        forms, quality ratings selection, surveys and comment boxes for
        blogging. From a machine perspective the data publisher can also record
        metrics on data usage or information about specific applications
        that use the data. Feedback such as this establishes
        a communication channel between data publishers and data
        consumers. Publicly
        available feedback should be displayed in a human-readable form.</p>
      <p>This section provides some Best Practices to be followed by data publishers in
        order to enable consumers to provide feedback. This feedback can be for humans or machines. </p>

        <section class="axioms">
          <h4 class="subhead">Why</h4>
          <p>Obtaining feedback helps publishers understand the needs of their data consumers and can help them improve the quality of their published data. It also enhances trust by showing consumers that the publisher cares about addressing their needs. Specifying a clear feedback mechanism removes the barrier of having to search for a way to provide feedback.</p>

          <p>Provide data consumers with one or more feedback mechanisms including, but not limited to, a contact form, point and click data quality rating buttons, or a comment box. In order to make the most of feedback received from consumers, it's a good idea to collect the feedback with a tracking system that captures each item in a database, enabling quantification and analysis. It is also a good idea to capture the type of each item of feedback, i.e., its motivation (editing, classifying [rating], commenting or questioning), so that each item can be expressed using the Dataset Usage Vocabulary [[VOCAB-DUV]].</p>

      <h3>Data Enrichment</h3>
      <p>Data enrichment refers to a set of processes that can be used to enhance, refine or otherwise improve raw or previously processed data. This idea and other similar concepts contribute to making data a valuable asset for almost any modern business or enterprise. It is a diverse topic in itself, details of which are beyond the scope of the current document. However, it is worth noting that some of these techniques should be approached with caution, as ethical concerns may arise. In scientific research, care must be taken to avoid enrichment that distorts results or statistical outcomes. For data about individuals, privacy issues may arise when combining datasets. That is, enriching one dataset with another, when neither contains sufficient information about any individual to identify them, may yield a combined dataset that compromises privacy. Furthermore, these techniques can be carried out at scale, which in turn highlights the need for caution.</p>
      <p>This section provides some advice to be followed by data publishers in
        order to enrich data.</p>

      <div class="practice">
        <p><span id="EnrichData" class="practicelab">Enrich data by generating new data</span></p>
        <p class="practicedesc">Enrich your data by generating new data when doing so will enhance its value.</p>
        <section class="axioms">
          <h4 class="subhead">Why</h4>
          <p>Enrichment can greatly enhance processability, particularly for unstructured data. Under some circumstances, missing values can be filled in, and new attributes and measures can be added from the existing raw data. Datasets can also be enriched by gathering additional results in the same fashion as the original data, or by combining the original data with other datasets. Publishing more complete datasets can enhance trust, if done properly and ethically. Deriving additional values that are of general utility saves users time and encourages more kinds of reuse. There are many intelligent techniques that can be used to enrich data, making the dataset an even more valuable asset.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="outcome">
          <h4 class="subhead">Intended Outcome</h4>
          <p>Datasets with missing values will be enhanced by filling in those values. Structure will be conferred and utility enhanced if relevant measures or attributes are added, but only if the addition does not distort analytical results, significance, or statistical power.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="how">
          <h4 class="subhead">Possible Approaches to Implementation</h4>
          <p>Techniques for data enrichment are complex and go well beyond the scope of this document, which can only highlight the possibilities.</p>
          <p>Machine learning can readily be applied to the enrichment of data. Methods include those focused on data categorization, disambiguation, entity recognition, sentiment analysis and topification, among others. New data values may be derived as simply as performing a mathematical calculation across existing columns. Other examples include visual inspection to identify features in spatial data and cross-reference to external databases for demographic information. Lastly, generation of new data may be demand-driven, where missing values are calculated or otherwise determined by direct means.</p>
          <p>Values generated by inference-based techniques should be labeled as such, and it should be possible to retrieve any original values replaced by enrichment.</p>
          <p>Whenever licensing permits, the code used to enrich the data should be made available along with the dataset. Sharing such code is particularly important for scientific data.</p>
          <p>Prioritization of enrichment activities should be based on value to the data consumer as well as the effort required. Value to the consumer can be gauged by measurement of demand (e.g., through surveys or tracking direct requests). Documenting how you measure demand can make the increased value demonstrable.</p>
          <p> If you make enrichments to someone else’s data, it’s a good idea to offer those enrichments back to the original publisher. </p>
          <aside class="example"><ol>
            <li>The MyCity transport agency has street addresses for each of its transit stops. It wants to make it easier for consumers of its data to combine the data with maps, so it adds latitude and longitude information for each stop by utilizing a geographic database.</li>
            <li>The transit agency has a large collection of email correspondence from transit riders. Some of the correspondence is complimentary, some emails are complaints, and some are requests for information. The agency conducts a combination of sentiment analysis and categorization to extract metadata for each of the messages, such as transit mode, route number, and rider positivity, to create a semi-structured dataset.</li></ol>

        </section>
        <section class="test">
          <h4 class="subhead">How to Test</h4>
          <p>Verify that there are no missing values in the dataset, or additional fields likely to be needed by others, that could readily be provided. Check that any data added by inferential enrichment techniques is identified as such and that any replaced data is still available.</p>

          <p>Data published online is meant to inform others about its subject. But only posting datasets for download or API access puts the burden on consumers to interpret it. The Web offers unparalleled opportunities for presenting data in ways that let users learn and explore without having to create their own tools.</p>

          <!--p>Besides making datasets available for download, processing, and reuse, publishers should give human consumers immediate insight into the data by presenting it in ways that are readily understood.

        </section>
        <section class="how">
          <h4 class="subhead">Possible Approaches to Implementation</h4>
          <p>One very simple way to provide immediate insight is to publish an analytical summary in an HTML page. Including summative data in graphs or tables can help users scan the summary and quickly understand the meaning of the data.</p>
          <p>If you have the means to create interactive visualizations or Web applications that use the data, you can give consumers of your data greater ability to understand it and discover patterns in it. These approaches also demonstrate its suitability for processing and encourage reuse.</p>
          <aside class="example">
            <p>The MyCity transit agency publishes detailed data about all its transit lines through an API, but it also has many users who are not Web developers and who want to know how to use the system to move about the city. The transit agency could build a Web application that allows users to enter a departure address and a destination and receive step-by-step directions for making their journey via public transit.</p>

          <p>Data Archiving is the set of practices around the storage and
            monitoring of the state of digital material over the years. </p>
          <p>These tasks are the responsibility of a Trusted Digital Repository
            (TDR), also sometimes referred to as <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4810">Long-Term
              Archive Service (LTA)</a>. Often such services follow the Open
              Archival Information System [[OAIS]] which defines the archival process
            in terms of ingest, monitoring and reuse of data.</p>

      <h2>Best Practices Benefits</h2>
      <p>The list below describes the main benefits of applying the DWBP. Each benefit represents an improvement in the way how datasets are available on the Web.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Comprehension: humans will have a better understanding about the
          data structure, the data meaning, the metadata and the nature of the
          dataset. </li>
        <li>Processability: machines will be able to automatically process and
          manipulate the data within a dataset.</li>
        <li>Discoverability machines will be able to automatically discover a
          dataset or data within a dataset.</li>
        <li>Reuse: the chances of dataset reuse by different groups of data
          consumers will increase.</li>
        <li>Trust: the confidence that consumers have in the dataset will
          improve.</li>
        <li>Linkability: it will be possible to create links between data
          resources (datasets and data items).</li>
        <li>Access: humans and machines will be able to access up to date data
          in a variety of forms.</li>
        <li>Interoperability: it will be easier to reach consensus among data
          publishers and consumers.</li>
