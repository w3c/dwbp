:Dimension a owl:Class, rdfs:Class ;

  rdfs:label "User Quality feedback"@en ;
  rdfs:comment "Represents feedback users might want to associate to datasets or distributions. Besides dqv:qualityAssessment which is the motivation required by all quality annotations, one of the predefined instances of oa:Motivation should be indicated as motivation to distinguish among the different kinds of feedback, e.g, classifications, questions."@en ;

In the current version of DQV, we also leave open the choice of the containment technique. Implementers can use (RDF) graph containment. They may also use a dedicated property of their choice to link instances of dqv:QualityMetadata with instances of other DQV classes. For example using (a subproperty of) dcterms:hasPart"@en
