      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        The deliverables of the Best Practices for Data on the Web include of documents that aim to to facilitate the work between data consumers and data publishers. To fulfill this mission, the WG decided to build a Glossary to ensure the common ground terms between pdata consumers and data publishers.
      </p>
      <p>There is a mental model listed to ensure that the scope is delimited.</p>

Vocabularies play a very important role in Linked Data, specifically to help with data integration. The use of this term overlaps with Ontology.</p>
