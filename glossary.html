      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        The deliverables of the Best Practices for Data on the Web include of documents that aim to to facilitate the work between data consumers and data publishers. To fulfill this mission, the WG decided to build a Glossary to ensure the common ground terms between pdata consumers and data publishers.
      </p>
      <p>There is a mental model listed to ensure that the scope is delimited.</p>

  <h3>Data Preservation</h3>
  <p><dfn id="data-preservation"><abbr title="Data Preservation">Data Preservation</abbr></dfn> is defined by <a href="http://www.alliancepermanentaccess.org/index.php/consultancy/dpglossary/#Preservation">APA</a> as "The processes and operations in ensuring the technical and intellectual survival of objects through time". This is part of a data management plan <a href="http://guide.dhcuration.org/preservation/">focusing on preservation planning and meta-data</a>. Whether it is worthwhile to put effort into preservation depends on the (future) value of the data, the resources available and the opinion of the stakeholders (= designated community)</p>

  <h3>Data Archiving</h3>

  <p>
    <dfn id="data-archiving"><abbr title="Data Archiving">Data Archiving</abbr></dfn> is the set of practices around the storage and monitoring of the state of digital material over the years. </p>
  <p>
  These tasks are the responsibility of a Trusted Digital Repository (TDR), also sometimes referred to as <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4810">Long-Term Archive Service (LTA)</a>. Often such services follow the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Archival_Information_System">Open Archival Information System</a>  which defines the archival process in terms of ingest, monitoring and re-use of data.

    <h3>File Format</h3>
    <p>
    <dfn id="file-format"><abbr title="File Format">File Format</abbr></dfn> is a standard way that information is encoded for storage in a computer file. It specifies how bits are used to encode information in a digital storage medium. File formats may be either proprietary or free and may be either unpublished or open.
    <p>Examples of file formats: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_file#.TXT">txt</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Document_Format">pdf</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postscript">ps</a>,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_Video_Interleave">avi</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GIF">gif</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG">jpg</a></p>

  <h3>Machine Readable Data</h3>
  <p>
    <dfn id="machine-readable"><abbr title="Machine Readable Data">Machine Readable Data</abbr></dfn> are data formats that may be readily parsed by computer programs without access to proprietary libraries. For example <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values">CSV</a> and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/NOTE-rdf11-primer-20140624/#section-graph-syntax">RDF turtle family for graphs</a> are machine readable, but <a href="http://www.data.gov/developers/blog/primer-machine-readability-online-documents-and-data">PDF</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG">Jpeg</a> are not.

  <p>
    <dfn id="vocabulary"><abbr title="Vocabulary">Vocabulary</abbr></dfn> is A collection of "terms" for a particular purpose. Vocabularies can range from simple such as the widely used <a href="">RDF Schema</a>, <a href="http://xmlns.com/foaf/spec/">Foaf</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin_Core#Dublin_Core_Metadata_Element_Set_Version_1.1">Dublin Core Metadata Element Set</a> to complex vocabularies with thousands of terms, such as those used in healthcare to describe symptoms, diseases and treatments. Vocabularies play a very important role in Linked Data, specifically to help with data integration. The use of this term overlaps with Ontology.</p>
