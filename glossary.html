	<h1>Reference Glossary</h1>

	<h3>Dataset</h3>

	<p>From <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat/">DCAT</a> 
	A dataset is defined as a "collection of data, published or curated by a single agent, and available for access or download in one or more formats". A dataset does not have to be available as a downloadable file.</p> 

	<h3>Data representation</h3>
	From <a href="http://guide.dhcuration.org/representation/">DH Curation Guide</a> 
	By "data representation" we mean any convention for the arrangement of symbols in such a way as to enable information to be encoded by a data producer and later decoded by data consumers.

	<h3>Data format</h3>
	From <a href="http://guide.dhcuration.org/representation/">DH Curation Guide</a> 
	Specific convention for data representation i.e. the way that information is encoded and stored for use in a computer system, possibly constrained by a formal data type or set of standards.t of standards.
	:Examples of data formats: CSV, XML, RDF and JSON.

	<h3>File Format</h3>
	<p>From <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_format">Wikipedia</a>
	Is a standard way that information is encoded for storage in a computer file. It specifies how bits are used to encode information in a digital storage medium. File formats may be either proprietary or free and may be either unpublished or open.

	Examples of file formats: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_file#.TXT">txt</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Document_Format">pdf</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postscript">ps</a>,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_Video_Interleave">avi</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GIF">gif</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG">jpg</a></p> 

	<h3>Machine Readable Data</h3>
	<p>From <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/ld-glossary/#vocabulary">Linked Data Glossary</a> 
	Data formats that may be readily parsed by computer programs without access to proprietary libraries. For example <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values">CSV</a> and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/NOTE-rdf11-primer-20140624/#section-graph-syntax">RDF turtle family for graphs</a> are machine readable, but PDF and Microsoft Excel are not.</p>

	<h3>Vocabulary</h3>
	<p>From: <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/ld-glossary/#vocabulary">Linked Data Glossary</a>
	A collection of "terms" for a particular purpose. Vocabularies can range from simple such as the widely used <a href="">RDF Schema</a>, <a href="http://xmlns.com/foaf/spec/">Foaf</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin_Core#Dublin_Core_Metadata_Element_Set_Version_1.1">Dublin Core Metadata Element Set</a> to complex vocabularies with thousands of terms, such as those used in healthcare to describe symptoms, diseases and treatments. Vocabularies play a very important role in Linked Data, specifically to help with data integration. The use of this term overlaps with Ontology.</p> 

	<h3>Structured data</h3> 
	<p>From Bernadette: structured data refers to data that conforms to a fixed schema. Relational databases and spreadsheets are examples of structured data.</p>
