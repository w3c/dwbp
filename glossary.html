	<dt>Annotation</dt>
  <dd>From:  <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/WD-annotation-model-20141211/#annotation">Annotation</a> 
         An Annotation is a web resource and should have an HTTP URI. Typically an Annotation has a single Body, which is a comment or other descriptive resource, and a single Target that the Body is somehow "about". 

	<dt>Citation</dt>
  <dd>From:  <a href="http://www.essepuntato.it/lode/http://purl.org/spar/cito">CiTO</a> 
        May be either direct and explicit (as in the reference list of a journal article), indirect (e.g. a citation to a more recent paper by the same research group on the same topic), or implicit (e.g. as in artistic quotations or parodies, or in cases of plagiarism).</dd>

	<dt>Dataset</dt>
	<dd>From <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat/">DCAT</a> 
	A dataset is defined as a "collection of data, published or curated by a single agent, and available for access or download in one or more formats". A dataset does not have to be available as a downloadable file.</dd> 

	<dt>Data consumer</dt>
  <dd>From:  Strong, Diane M., Yang W. Lee, and Richard Y. Wang. "Data quality in context." Communications of the ACM 40.5 (1997): 103-110. 
       A person or group accessing, using, and potentially performing post-processing steps on data.  </dd>

	<dt>Data format</dt>
  <dd>From <a href="http://guide.dhcuration.org/representation/">DH Curation Guide</a> 
  Specific convention for data representation i.e. the way that information is encoded and stored for use in a computer system, possibly constrained by a formal data type or set of standards.t of standards.
  <br>
  Examples of data formats: CSV, XML, RDF and JSON.</dd>

	<dt>Data producer</dt>
  <dd>From:  Strong, Diane M., Yang W. Lee, and Richard Y. Wang. "Data quality in context." Communications of the ACM 40.5 (1997): 103-110. 
       A person or group responsible for generating and maintaining data.  </dd>

	<dt>Data representation</dt>
  <dd>From <a href="http://guide.dhcuration.org/representation/">DH Curation Guide</a> 
  By "data representation" we mean any convention for the arrangement of symbols in such a way as to enable information to be encoded by a data producer and later decoded by data consumers.</dd>

	<dt>Feedback</dt>
  <dd>From:  (1) <a href="http://rdfs.org/sioc/spec/#sec-modules-types">SIOC</a>, (2) <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/#motivations">Annotation#Motivation</a> 
       (1) A forum used to collect messages posted by consumers about a particular topic. Messages can include replies to other consumers.   Datetime stamps are associated with each message and the messages can be associated with a person or submitted anonymously. (2) To better understand why annotation (See Annotation) was created <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/skos-reference/">SKOS</a> is used to show inter-related annotation  between communities with more meaningful distinctions than a simple class/subclass tree.</dd>

    <dt>Data Preservation</dt>
<dd>APA <a href="http://www.alliancepermanentaccess.org/index.php/consultancy/dpglossary/#Preservation">defines</a> preservation as "The processes and operations in ensuring the technical and intellectual survival of objects through time". This is part of a data management plan <a href="http://guide.dhcuration.org/preservation/">focusing on preservation planning and meta-data</a>. Whether it is worthwhile to put effort into preservation depends on the (future) value of the data, the resources available and the opinion of the stakeholders (= designated community)</dd>

    <dt>Data Archiving</dt>
<dd>Data archiving is the set of practices around the storage and monitoring of the state of digital material over the years. These tasks are the responsibility of a Trusted Digital Repository (TDR), also sometimes referred to as <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4810">Long-Term Archive Service (LTA)</a>. Often such services follow the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Archival_Information_System">Open Archival Information System</a>  which defines the archival process in terms of ingest, monitoring and re-use of data.</dd>
    
	<dt>File Format</dt>
	<dd>From <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_format">Wikipedia</a>
	Is a standard way that information is encoded for storage in a computer file. It specifies how bits are used to encode information in a digital storage medium. File formats may be either proprietary or free and may be either unpublished or open.
  <br>
	Examples of file formats: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_file#.TXT">txt</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Document_Format">pdf</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postscript">ps</a>,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audio_Video_Interleave">avi</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GIF">gif</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG">jpg</a></dd> 

	<dt>Machine Readable Data</dt>
	<dd>From <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/ld-glossary/#vocabulary">Linked Data Glossary</a> 
	Data formats that may be readily parsed by computer programs without access to proprietary libraries. For example <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values">CSV</a> and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/NOTE-rdf11-primer-20140624/#section-graph-syntax">RDF turtle family for graphs</a> are machine readable, but <a href="http://www.data.gov/developers/blog/primer-machine-readability-online-documents-and-data">PDF</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG">Jpeg</a> are not.</dd>

        <dt>Structured data</dt>
        <dd>From Bernadette: structured data refers to data that conforms to a fixed schema. Relational databases and spreadsheets are examples of structured data.</dd>

	<dt>Vocabulary</dt>
	<dd>From: <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/ld-glossary/#vocabulary">Linked Data Glossary</a>
	A collection of "terms" for a particular purpose. Vocabularies can range from simple such as the widely used <a href="">RDF Schema</a>, <a href="http://xmlns.com/foaf/spec/">Foaf</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin_Core#Dublin_Core_Metadata_Element_Set_Version_1.1">Dublin Core Metadata Element Set</a> to complex vocabularies with thousands of terms, such as those used in healthcare to describe symptoms, diseases and treatments. Vocabularies play a very important role in Linked Data, specifically to help with data integration. The use of this term overlaps with Ontology.</dd>
