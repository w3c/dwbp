    <p>A use case describes a scenario that illustrates an experience of publishing and using Data on the Web.The information gathered from the uses cases should be helpful for the identification of the best practices that will guide the publishing and usage of Data on the Web. In general, a best practice will be described at least by a statement and a how to do it section, i.e., a discussion of techniques and suggestions as how to implement it. Use cases descriptions shows some of the main challenges faced by publishers or developers. Information about challenges will be helpful to identify areas where Best Practices are necessary. According to the challenges,  a set of requirements were defined, in such a way that a requirement motivates the creation of one or more best practices.</p>

  </p>
  <p>While many cases of Data on the Web may contain meta-data
  about creation data and last update, the regularity of the
  release schedule is not always clear. Similarly, how and by whom
  the dataset is supported should also be made clear in the
  meta-data. These attributes are necessary to improve the
  reliability of the data so that third-party users can trust the
  timely delivery of the data, with a follow-up point should there
  be any issues.</p>

    <p>One of the advantages of publishing Open Data is often
    quoted as improving the quality of the data. Many eyes looking
    at a dataset helps spot errors and holes quicker than a public
    body may identify this themselves. For example, when bus-stop
    data is published, it may turn out that the official location
    of a bus-stop is not always accurate, but when this is
    mashed-up with OSM, the mistake is identified. However, how
    this 'improved' data is fed back into the public body is not
    clear. Should there be an automated mechanism for this? How can
    the improvement be described in a machine readable format? What
    is best practice for reincorporating such improvements?</p>

    </p>
    <p>There are many potential/perceived benefits of Open Data,
    however in order to publish data, some initial
    investment/resources are required by public bodies. When
    justifying these resources and evaluating the impact of the
    investment, many Open Data providers express the desire to be
    able to track how the datasets are being used. However Open
    Data by design often requires no registration, explanation or
    feedback to enable the access to and usage of the data. How can
    data usage be tracked in order to inform the Open Data
    ecosystem and improve data provision?</p>

    <p>Axel presented the Open City Data Pipeline, which aims to to
    provide an extensible platform to support citizens and city
    administrators by providing city key performance indicators
    (KPIs),leveraging Open Data sources. The assumption of Open
    Data is the &#8220;Added value comes from comparable Open
    datasets being combined&#8221;. Axel highlighted that Open Data
    needs stronger standards to be useful, in particular for
    industrial uptake. Industrial usage has different requirements
    than app hobbyist or civil society, it's important to think how
    Open Data can be used by industry at time of publication. They
    have developed a data pipeline to 
  <ol>
<li> (semi-)automatically collect and integrate various Open Data Sources in different formats  
</li>
<li> compose and calculate complex city KPIs from the collected data 
</li>
</ol>
<p>Current Data Summary
</p>
<ul>
<li> Ca. 475 different indicators 
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> Categories: Demography, Geography, Social Aspects, Economy, Environment, etc.

Challenges &amp; Lessons Learnt:
</p>
<ul>
<li> <b>Incomplete</b> Data: can be partially overcome  
</li>

<ul>
<li> By ontological reasoning (RDF &amp; OWL), by aggregation, or by rules &amp; equations, e.g. &#160;:populationDensity =&#160;:population /&#160;:area , cf. [ESWC2013]  
</li>
</ul>
 
<ul>
<li> By statistical methods or Multi-dimensional Matrix Decomposition:  
</li>
</ul> 
</ul>(unfortunately only partially successful, because these algorithms assume normally-distributed data.) 
<ul>
<li> <b>Incomparable</b> Data:   
</li>
<ul>
<li> dbpedia:populationTotal </li>
 <li>dbpedia:populationCensus </li>
 </ul>
 </ul>
<ul>
<li> <b>Heterogeneity</b> across Open Government Data efforts:  
</li>

<ul>
<li> Different <b>Indicators</b>, Different Temporal and Spatial Granularity  
</li>
<li> Different <b>Licenses</b> of Open Data: e.g. CC-BY, country specific licences, etc.  
</li>
<li> Heterogeneous <b>Formats</b> (CSV&#160;!= CSV) ... Maybe the W3C CSV on the Web WG will solve this issue)

          <p>There are many different licenses available under

          <p>A main focus of publishing data on the web is to
          facilitate industry resuse for commercial purposes. In
          order for a commercial body to reuse data on the web, the
          terms of reuse must be clear. The legal terms of reuse
          are included in the license, but there are other factors
          that are important for commercial reuse, e.g. reliabiliy,
          support, incidient recovery, etc. These could be included
          in an SLA. Is there a standardised, machine-readable
          approach to SLAs?</p>

          <p>APIs are commonly used to publish data in formats
          designed for machine-consumption, as opposed to the
          corresponding HTML pages whose main aim is to deliver
          content suitable for human-consumption. There remains 
          <a href="http://ruben.verborgh.org/blog/2013/11/29/the-lie-of-the-api/">
          questions</a>around how APIs can best be designed to
          publish data, and even if APIs are the most suitable way
          for publishing data at all . Could use of HTTP and URIs
          be sufficient? If the goal is to facilitate
          machine-readable data, what is best-practice?</p>

          <p>Recife is a beautiful city situated in the Northeast
          of Brazil and it is famous for being one of the
          Brazil&#8217;s biggest tech hubs. Recife is also one of
          the first Brazilian cities to release data generated by
          public sector organisations for public use as Open Data.
          Then 
          <a href="http://dados.recife.pe.gov.br/">Open Data Portal
          Recife</a>was created to offer access to a repository of
          governmental machine-readable data about several domains,
          including: finances, health, education and tourism. Data
          is available in csv and geojson format and every dataset
          has a metadata description, i.e. descriptions of the
          data, that helps in the understanding and usage of the
          data. However, the metadata is not described using
          standard vocabularies or taxonomies. In general, data is
          created in a static way, where data from relational
          databases are exported in a csv format and then published
          in the data catalog. Currently, they are working to have
          dynamically generated data from the contents of
          relational databases, then data will be available as soon
          as they are created. The main phases of the development
          of this initiative were: to educate people with
          appropriate knowledge concerning Open Data, relevant data
          identification in order to identify the sources of data
          that their pontential consumers could find useful, data
          extraction and transformation from the original data
          sources to the open data format, configuration and
          installation of the open data catalogue tool, data
          publication and portal release.</p>

          thousands of catalogs like that today, but they need to
          manage them better. In their platform, they store the
          information in a more conventional manner, and use this
          standard for export dataset compliant to Inspire
          interoperability , or via the CSW protocol. Sometimes,

			The Netherlands have a <a href = "http://e-overheid.nl/onderwerpen/stelselinformatiepunt/stelsel-van-basisregistraties/basisregistraties"> set of registers </a> they are looking at opening and exposing as Linked (Open) Data under the context of the project <a href = "http://www.pilod.nl/wiki/Hoofdpagina">"PiLOD" </a>. The registers contain information about buildings, people, businesses and other individuals public bodies may want to refer to for they daily activities. One of them is, for instance, the service of public taxes ("BelastingDienst") which regularly pulls out data from several registers, stores this data in a big Oracle instance and curates it. This costly and time consuming process could be optimised by providing on-demand access to up-to-date descriptions provided by the register owners.
		</p>
		
		<p> <strong>Technical Challenges:</strong> </p>
		In terms of challenges, linking is for once not much of an issue as <a href = "http://www.e-overheid.nl/onderwerpen/stelselinformatiepunt/stelselthemas/verbindingen/verbindingen-tussen-basisregistraties"> registers already cross-reference unique identifiers </a> (see also <a href= "http://www.wikixl.nl/wiki/gemma/index.php/Ontsluiting_basisgegevens"> http://www.wikixl.nl/wiki/gemma/index.php/Ontsluiting_basisgegevens </a>). A <a href = "http://www.pilod.nl/wiki/Boek/URI-strategie"> URIs scheme </a>  with predicable URIs is being considered for implementation. Actual challenges include:
		<ul>
			<li> Capacity: at this point, it can not be asked that every register owner cares for publishing his own data. Some of them export what they have on the national open data portal. This data has been used to do some testing with third-party publication from PiLODers but this is rather sensitive as a long term strategy (governmental data has to be tracable/trustable as such). The middle ground solution currently deployed is the PiLOD platform, a (semi)-official platform for publishing register data.</li>
			<li> Privacy: some of the register data is personal or may become so when linked to others (e.g. disambiguate personal data based on adresses). Some registers will require to provide secured access to some of their data to some people only (Linked Data, not Open). Some others can go along with open data as long as they get a precise log of who is using what.</li>
			<li> Revenue: institutions working under mixed gov/non-gov funding generate part of their revenue by selling some of the data they curate. Switching to an open data model will generate a direct loss in revenue that has to be backed-up by other means. This does not have to mean closing the data, e.g. a model of open dereferencing + paid dumps can be considered, as well as other indirect revenue streams. </li>

        research for the U.S. Department of Energy&#8217;s Office
        of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) Wind and
        Water Power Program. The Reference Facility for Renewable
        Energy (RFORE) project is responsible collecting wind
        characterization data from remote sensing and in situ
        instruments located on an offshore platform. This raw data
        is collected by the Data Management Facility and processed
        into a standardized NetCDF format. Both the raw
        measurements and processed data are archived in the PNNL
        Institutional Computing (PIC) petascale computing facility.
        The DMF will record all processing history, quality
        assurance work, problem reporting, and maintenance
        activities for both instrumentation and data. All datasets,
        instrumentation, and activities are cataloged providing a
        seamless knowledge representation of the scientific study.
        The DMF catalog relies on linked open vocabularies and
        domain vocabularies to make the study data searchable.

          SME use of public data</h3>

          <p>Buildingeye.com makes building and planning
          information easier to find and understand by mapping
          what's happening in your city. In Ireland local
          authorities handle planning applications and usually
          provide some customised views of the data (pdfs, maps,
          etc.) on their own website. However there isn't an easy
          way to get a nationwide view of the data. BuildingEye, an
          independent SME, built 
          <a href="http://mypp.ie/">http://mypp.ie/</a>to achieve
          this. However as each local authority didn't have an Open
          Data portal, BuildingEye had to directly ask each local
          authority for its data. It was granted access to some
          authorities, but not all. The data it did receive was in
          different formats and of varying quality/detail.
          BuildingEye harmonised this data for its own system.
          However, if another SME wanted to use this data, they
          would have to go through the same process and again go to
          each local authority asking for the data.</p>

          archiving of Linked Data</h3>

            <span style="font-size: 10pt">(Contributed by
            Christophe Gu&#233;ret)</span>
          </p>
          <p>Taking the concrete example of the digital archive 
          <a href="http://dans.knaw.nl/">"DANS"</a>, digital
          archives have so far been concerned with the preservation
          of what could be defined as "frozen" dataset. A frozen
          dataset is a finished, self-contained, set of data that
          does not evolve after it has been constituted. The goal
          of the preserving institution is to ensure this dataset
          remains available and readable for as many years as
          possible. This can for example concern an audio record, a
          digitized image, e-books or database dumps. Consumers of
          the data are expected to look-up for a specific content
          based on its associated 
          <a href="http://www.persid.org/">persistent
          identifier</a>, download it from the archive and use it.
          Now comes the 
          <a href="http://www.prelida.eu/">question of the
          preservation of Linked Open Data.</a>In opposition to
          "frozen" data sets, linked data can be qualified as
          "live" data. The resources it contains are part of a
          larger entity to which third parties contribute, one of
          the design principles indicate that other data producers
          and consumers should be able to point to data. As LD
          publishers stop offering their data (e.g. at the end of a
          project), taking the LD off-line as a dump and putting it
          in an archive effectively turns it into a frozen dataset,
          likewise to SQL dumps and other kind of data bases. The
          question then raises as to which extent this is an
          issue...</p>
          <p>
          <strong>Technical Challenges:</strong>The archive has to
          think about whether serving dereferencing for resources
          found in preserved datasets is required or not, also
          think about providing a SPARQL end point or not. If data
          consumers and publishers are fine with having RDF data
          dumps to be downloaded from the archive prior to its
          usage - just like any other digital item so far - the
          technical challenges could be limited to handling the
          size of the dumps and taking care of serialisation
          evolution over time (e.g. from Ntriples to Trig, or from
          RDF/XML to 
          <a href="http://www.rdfhdt.org/">HDT</a>) as the
          preference for these formats evolves. Turning a live
          dataset into a frozen dump also raises the question of
          the scope. Considering that LD items are only part of a
          much larger graph that gives them meaning through context
          the only valid dump would be a complete snapshot of the
          entire connected component of the Web of Data graph the
          target dataset is part of.</p>
          <p>
          <strong>Potential Requirements:</strong>Decide on the
          importance of the de-referencability of resources and the
          potential implications for domain names and naming of
          resources. Decide on the scope of the step that will turn
          a connected sub-graph into an isolated data dump.</p>

  </p>
  <p>Uruguay open data site holds 85 datasets containing 114
  resources since the first dataset was published in Dec. 2012.
  Open data initiative prioritizes the &#8220;use of data&#8221;
  rather than &#8220;quantity of data&#8221;, that&#8217;s why the
  catalogue holds 25 applications using datasets resources in some
  way. It&#8217;s important for the project to keep the relation
  1/3 between applications and datasets. Most of the resources are
  CSV and shapefiles; basically we have a 3 stars catalogue and the
  reason why we can&#8217;t go to the next level is the lack of
  resources (time, human, economic, etc.) at government agencies to
  implement an open data liberation strategy. So when we are asked
  about opening data, keep it simple is the answer, and CSV is far
  the easiest and smart way to start. Uruguay has an Access to
  public information law but don&#8217;t have legislation about
  open data. The open data initiative is leaded by AGESIC with the
  support of the open data working group. OD Working group: -

      <p>Retailers and Manufacturers / Brand Owners are beginning
      to understand that there can be benefits to openly publishing
      structured data about products and product offerings on the
      web as Linked Open Data. Some of the initial benefits may be
      enhanced search listing results (e.g. Google Rich Snippets)
      that improve the likelihood of consumers choosing such a
      product or product offer over an alternative product that
      lacks the enhanced search results. However, the longer term
      vision is that an ecosystem of new product-related services
      can be enabled if such data is available. Many of these will
      be consumer-facing and might be accessed via smartphones and
      other mobile devices, to help consumers to find the products
      and product offers that best match their search criteria and
      personal preferences or needs - and to alert them if a
      particular product is incompatible with their dietary
      preferences or other criteria such as ethical / environmental
      impact considerations - and to suggest an alternative product
      that may be a more suitable match. The complete description
      of this use case may be found

          <li>vision is to enable an ecosystem of new digital apps
          around product data</li>
          <li>the food sector in the EU is already obliged under
          new food labelling legislation (EU 1169 / 2011, Article
          14) to provide the same amount of information about a
          food product that is sold online to consumers as the
          information that would be available to them from the
          product packaging if they picked up the product in-store.
          Although the legislation does not suggest that Linked
          Open Data technology should be used to make the same
          information available in a machine-readable format, there
          is currently significant investment and effort to upgrade
          websites to provide accurate and detailed information
          about food products; the GS1 Digital team consider that
          for a relatively small amount of effort, these companies
          could gain some tangible benefits (e.g. enhanced search
          results) from such compliance efforts by using Linked
          Open Data technology within their web pages.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Usage:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>data providing transparency about product
          characteristics</li>
          <li>data used to help consumers make informed choices
          about which products to buy/consume</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Quality: Very important to have trustworthy
        authoritative data from respective organizations</li>
        <li>Size: Typically 20+ factual claims per product -
        probably 40+ RDF triples</li>
        <li>Type/format: HTML + RDFa / JSON-LD / Microdata</li>
        <li>Rate of change: mostly static data initially - but
        subject to some variation over time</li>
        <li>Data lifespan: data should remain accessible until
        products are no longer considered to be in circulation;
        this represents a challenge for deprecated product lines
        data that is stated authoritatively by one organization
        might be embedded / referenced in the data asserted by
        another organization; this raises concerns about whether
        embedded data becomes stale if it is inadequately
        synchronized, that referenced data is not dereferenced (and
        therefore not discovered / gathered) by consumers or the
        data. From a liability perspective, there also needs to be
        clarity about which organization asserted which factual
        information - and also information about which organization
        has the authority to assert specific factual claims.</li>
        <li>Potential audience: machine-readable (search engines,
        data aggregators, mobile apps etc.)</li>
		</ul>
        <p>
          <strong>Technical Challenges:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Linked Open Data about products is likely to be
          highly distributed in nature and various parties have
          authority over specific claims</li>
          <li>Accreditation agencies have authority over
          ethical/environmental claims</li>
          <li>Brand owners / manufacturers have authority over
          product master data</li>
          <li>Retailers have authority over facts related to
          product offerings (price, availability etc.)</li>
          <li>An organization (e.g. retailer) might embed
          authoritative data asserted by another organization (e.g.
          brand owner) and there is the risk that such embedded
          information becomes stale if it is not continuously
          synchronized.</li>
          <li>An organization (e.g. retailer) might reference a
          graph of authoritative data that can be retrieved via an
          HTTP request to a remote HTTP URI. There is a risk that
          software or search engines consuming Linked Open Data
          containing such references may fail to dereference such
          HTTP URIs and in doing so may fail to gather all of the
          relevant data.</li>
          <li>Organizations are currently faced with a choice of
          whether to embed machine-readable structured data in
          their web pages using a block approach (e.g. using
          JSON-LD) or using an inline approach (e.g. using RDFa,
          RDFa Lite or Microdata). A block approach (JSON-LD) may
          be simpler and less brittle than inline annotation,
          especially as it can be easily decoupled from structural
          changes to the body of the web page that may happen over
          time in the redesign of a website. At present, tool
          support for the 3 major markup approaches for embedded
          Linked Open Data (RDFa, JSON-LD, MIcrodata) is unequal
          across the three formats and some tools may not export or
          import / ingest all 3 formats - some tools even fail to
          extract data from JSON-LD markup created by their
          corresponding export tool. There are some significant
          challenges to ensure that the structured data embedded
          within a web page is correctly linked to form coherent
          RDF triples, without any dangling nodes that should be
          connected to the Subject or other nodes.</li>
          <li>Only through the provision of best-in-class tool
          support that recognize all three major formats on a
          completely equal footing can organizations have any
          confidence that they can use any of the 3 major markup
          formats and the ability to verify / validate that their
          own markup does result in the correct RDF triples.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>Potential Requirements:</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The ability to determine who asserted various facts -
          and whether they are the organization that can assert
          those facts authoritatively.</li>
          <li>Where data from other sources is embedded, there is a
          risk that the embedded data might be stale. It is
          therefore helpful to indicate which graph of triples is a
          snapshot in time from data from another source - and to
          provide a link to the original source, so that the
          consumer of the data has the opportunity to obtain a
          fresh version of the live data rather than relying on a
          potentially stale snapshot graph of data. DWBP could
          provide guidance about how to indicate which graph of
          data is a snapshot and where it came from.</li>
          <li>Consumers of Linked Open Data about products might
          rely on it for making decisions - not only about purchase
          but even consumption. If the data about a product is
          inaccurate or out-of-date, we might need to provide some
          guidance about how liability terms and disclaimers can be
          expressed in Linked Open Data. We&#8217;re not suggesting
          that we define such terms from a legal perspective - but
          perhaps there is an existing framework in a similar way
          that there is an existing framework for expressing
          various licences of the data? If not, perhaps such a
          framework needs to be developed - but outside of the DWBP
          group? Licensing generally says what you&#8217;re allowed
          to do with the data - but I don&#8217;t think it says
          anything about liability for using the data or making
          decisions based on that data. This area probably needs
          some clarification, particularly if there is a risk of
          injury or death (due to inaccurate information about
          allergens in a food product).</li>

          <p>Tabul.ae is a framework to publish and visually
          explore data that can used to deploy powerful and
          easy-to-exploit open data platforms, so contributing
          organizations to unleash the potential of their data. The
          aim is to enable data owners (public organizations) and
          consumers (citizens and business re-users) to transform
          the information they manage into added-value knowledge,
          empowering them to easily create data-centric web
          applications. These applications are built upon
          interactive and powerful graphs, and take the shape of
          interactive charts, dashboards, infographies and reports.
          Tabulae provides a high degree of assistance to create
          these apps and also automate several data visualizations
          tasks (i.e., recognition of geographical entities to
          automatically generate a map). In addition, the charts
          and maps are portable outside the platform and can be
          smartly integrated with any web content, enhancing the
          reusability of the information.</p>

          <strong>Positive Aspects:</strong>the decision on
          transforming CSV in to JSON was based on the necessity to
          have hierarchical data - the positive point, that CSV
          structure can be mapped to an XML or JSON was considered.
          CSV only covers tabular format and JSON can cover more
          complex structures.</p>
          <p>
          <strong>Negative Aspects:</strong>the data was in CSV
          format, but it's now (2014) outdated, and there's no
