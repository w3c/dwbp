      <p>This document lists use cases, compiled by the Data on the
        Web Best Practices Working Group, that represent scenarios of how data
        is commonly published on the Web and how it is used. This document also
        provides a set of requirements derived from these use cases that will be
        used to guide the development of the set of Data on the Web Best
        Practices and the development of two new vocabularies: Quality and
        Granularity Description Vocabulary and Data Usage Description
        Vocabulary. </p>
    </section>
    <section id="sotd"> </section>
    <section class="informative">
      <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
      <p>There is a growing interest in publishing and consuming data on the
        Web. Both government and non-government organizations already make a
        variety of data available on the Web, some openly, some with access
        restrictions, covering many domains like education, the economy,
        security, cultural heritage, eCommerce and scientific data. Developers,
        journalists and others manipulate this data to create visualizations and
        to perform data analysis. Experience in this field shows that several
        important issues need to be addressed in order to meet the requirements
        of both data publishers and data consumers. </p>
      <p>To address these issues, the Data on the Web Best Practices Working
        Group seeks to provide guidance to all stakeholders that will improve
        consistency in the way data is published, managed, referenced and used
        on the Web. The guidance will take two forms: a set of best practices
        that apply to multiple technologies, and vocabularies that are currently
        missing but that are needed to support the data ecosystem on the Web.</p>
      <p>In order to determine the scope of the best practices and the
        requirements for the new vocabularies, a set of use cases has been
        compiled. Each use case provides a narrative describing an experience of
        publishing and using Data on the Web. The use cases cover different
        domains and illustrate some of the main challenges faced by data
        publishers and data consumers. A set of requirements, used to guide the
        development of the set of best practices as well as the development of
        the vocabularies, have been derived from the compiled use cases.</p>
      <p>Interpretations of each use case could lead to an unmanageably large
        number of requirements and so before including them, each potential
        requirement has been assessed against three specific criteria:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Is the requirement specifically relevant to data published on the
          Web?</li>
        <li>Does the requirement encourage reuse or publication of data on the
          Web?</li>
        <li>Is the requirement testable?</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Only requirements meeting those three criteria have been included.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2 id="use-cases">Use Cases</h2>
      <p>A use case illustrates an experience of publishing and using Data on
        the Web. The information gathered from the use cases should be helpful
        for the identification of the best practices that will guide the
        publishing and usage of Data on the Web. In general, a use case will be
        described at least by a statement and a discussion of how the use case
        is currently implemented. Use case descriptions demonstrate some of the
        main challenges faced by publishers or developers. Information about
        challenges will be helpful to identify areas where Best Practices are
        necessary. According to the challenges, a set of requirements are
        abstracted in such a way that a requirement motivates the creation of
        one or more best practices.</p>

        <h3 id="h3_UC-ASO" role="heading" aria-level="2">ASO: Airborne Snow
          Observatory</h3>
        <p class="contributor">(Contributed by Lewis John McGibbney, NASA Jet
          Propulsion Laboratory/California Institute of Technology)<br />
          URL: <a href="http://aso.jpl.nasa.gov/">http://aso.jpl.nasa.gov/</a></p>
        <p>The two most critical properties for understanding snowmelt runoff
          and timing are the spatial and temporal distributions of snow water
          equivalent (SWE) and snow albedo. Despite their importance in
          controlling volume and timing of runoff, snowpack albedo and SWE are
          still largely unquantified in the US and not at all in most of the
          globe, leaving runoff models poorly constrained. NASA/JPL, in
          partnership with the California Department of Water Resources, has
          developed the Airborne Snow Observatory (ASO), an imaging spectrometer
          and scanning Lidar system, to quantify SWE and snow albedo, generate
          unprecedented knowledge of snow properties for cutting edge
          cryospheric science, and provide complete, robust inputs to water
          management models and systems of the future.</p>
        <p><strong>Elements:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Domains:</strong> Digital Earth Modeling, Digital Surface
            Modeling, Spatial Distribution Measurement, Snow Depth, Snow Water
            Equivalent, Snow Albedo.</li>
          <li><strong>Obligation/motivation:</strong> Funding provided by NASA
            Terrestrial Hydrology, NASA Applied Sciences, and California
            Department of Water Resources.</li>
          <li><strong>Usage:</strong> Example data usage include &lt; 24hrs
            turnaround of flight data which is passed on to numerous Water
            Resource Managers aiding in water conservation usage, policy and
            decision making processes. Accurate and weekly spatially distributed
            SWE has never been produced before, and is highly informative to
            reservoir managers who must make tradeoffs between storing water for
            summer water supply versus using water before snowmelt recedes for
            generation of clean hydropower. Accurate SWE information, when
            coupled with runoff forecasting models, can also have ecological
            benefits through avoidance of late-spring high flows released from
            reservoirs that are not part of the natural seasonal variability.</li>
          <li><strong>Quality:</strong> Available in a number of scientific
            formats to customers and stakeholders based on customer
            requirements.</li>
          <li><strong>Lineage:</strong> All ASO data stems directly from
            on-board imaging spectrometer and scanning Lidar system instruments.</li>
          <li><strong>Size:</strong> Many many TB in size. Raw data acquisition
            is dependent on the basin/survey size. Recent individual flights
            generate in the order of ~500GB which include imaging spectrometer
            and Lidar data. This does however shrink considerably if we just
            consider the data that we would distribute.</li>
          <li><strong>Type/format:</strong> Digital Elevation Model / binary
            image (not public atm), Lidar (Raw Point Clouds)/ las (not public
            atm), Raster Zonal Stats / text (not public atm), Snow Water
            Equivalent / tiff, Snow Albedo / tiff</li>
          <li><strong>Rate of change:</strong> Recent weekly flights have
            provided information on a scale and timing that has never occurred
            before. Distributed SWE increases after storms, and decreases during
            melt events in patterns that have never before been measured and
            will be studied by snow hydrologists for years to come. Once data is
            captured it is not updated, however subsequent data is generated
            from the original data within processing pipelines which as
            screening for data quality control and assurance.</li>
          <li><strong>Data lifespan:</strong> For immediate operational
            purposes, the last flight's data become obsolete when a new flight
            is made. However, the annual sequence of data sets will be leveraged
            by snow hydrologists and runoff forecasters during the next decade
            as they are used to improve models and understanding of the spatial
            nature of the mountain snowpack.</li>
          <li><strong>Potential audience:</strong> (snow) hydrologists,
            hydrologic modelers, runoff forecasters, and reservoir operators and
            reservoir managers.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Positive aspects:</strong></p>
        <p>This use case provides insight into what a NASA funded demonstration
          mission looks like (from a data provenance, archival point of view).</p>
        <p>It is an excellent opportunity to delve into an earth science mission
          which is actively addressing the global problem of water resource
          management. Recently senior officials have declared a statewide (CA)
          drought emergency and are asking all Californians to reduce their
          water use by 20 percent. California, and other U.S. states are
          experiencing a serious drought and the state will be challenged to
          meet its water needs in the upcoming year. Calendar year 2013 was the
          driest year in recorded history for many areas of California, and
          current conditions suggest no change is in sight for 2014. ASO is at
          the front line of cutting edge scientific research meaning that the
          data that backs the mission, as well as the practices adopted within
          the project execution, are extremely important to addressing this
          issue.</p>
        <p>Project collaborators and stakeholders are sent data and information
          when it is produced and curated. For some stakeholders, the data (in
          an operational sense) they require is very small in size and in such
          cases ASO emphasizes speed. It's more like a sharing of information
          than delivering a product for the short-term turnaround of
          information. </p>
        <p><strong>Negative aspects:</strong></p>
        <p>Demonstration missions of this caliber also have downsides. With
          regards to data best practices, more work is required in the following
          areas:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Documentation of processes including data acquisition, provenance
            tracking, curation of data products such as bare earth digital earth
            models (DEM), full surface digital surface models (DSM), snow
            products, snow water equivalents (SWE), etc.</li>
          <li>Currently data is not searchable, this makes retrieval of specific
            data difficult when data volumes grow to this size and nature</li>
          <li>There is no publicly available guidance regarding suggested tools
            which can be used to interact with the data sources.</li>
          <li>Quick turnarounds of operational data may be compromised when ASO
            moves beyond a demonstration mission and picks up new customers etc.
            This will most likely be attributed to the time associations for the
            generation and distribution of science grade products.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Challenges: </strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Data volumes are large, and will grow by year on year. The volume
            of generated data grew by 50% between 2013 and 2014.</li>
          <li>On many occasions we require a very quick turn around on
            inferences which can be made from the data. This sometimes (but not
            always) comes at the cost of reducing the emphasis of best practices
            for the generation, storage and archival of projects data.</li>
          <li>The data takes the form of science oriented representational
            formats. Such formats are non-typical of the typical data many
            people publish on the Web. A lot of thought needs to be put in to
            how this data can be better accessed.</li>

        <p class="contributor"><strong>Contributors: </strong>Ghislain
          Atemezing (EURECOM)</p>
        <p><strong>URL: </strong><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/ontologies">http://www.bbc.co.uk/ontologies</a></p>
        <p><strong>Overview:</strong> the BBC provides a <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/ontologies">list
            of the ontologies</a> they implement and use for their Linked Data
          platform. The site provides access to the ontologies the BBC is using
          to support its audience using their applications, such as <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport">BBC
            Sport</a> or <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/education">BBC Education</a>.
          Each ontology has a short description with metadata information, an
          introduction, sample data, an ontology diagram and the terms used in
          the ontology. The metadata includes 6 fields that are generally
          filled: mailto authors, created data, version (current version
          number), prior version (decimal), license (a link to the license) and
          a link for downloading the RDF version. For example, see the
          description of the “<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/ontologies/coreconcepts">Core
            concepts ontology</a>.” However, this metadata that is available in
          the HTML page is NOT present in a machine-readable format, i.e. in the
          ontology itself.</p>
        <p><strong>Versioning:</strong> each ontology uses a decimal notation
          for the version and the URL for accessing each version file of the
          ontology is constructed as {BASE-URI}/{ONTO-PREFIX}/{VERSION}.ttl;
          where {BASE-URI} is <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/ontologies/">http://www.bbc.co.uk/ontologies/</a>.
          For example: the file of version 1.9 of the “core concepts” ontology
          is located at <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/ontologies/coreconcepts/1.9.ttl">http://www.bbc.co.uk/ontologies/coreconcepts/1.9.ttl</a>.
          However, between different versions, the URI of the ontology used is
          the same and is of the form : {BASE-URI}/{ONTO-PREFIX}/.</p>
        <p><strong>Elements:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Domains:</strong> vocabulary catalog, versioning, metadata
          </li>
          <li><strong>Obligation/motivation:</strong> Provide a unique point of

          <li><strong>Usage:</strong> The site provides access to the ontologies
            the BBC is using to support its audience using their applications, </li>
          <li><strong>Quality:</strong> High level and domain vocabularies
            adapted to BBC applications. </li>
          <li><strong>Size:</strong> currently, there are 12 ontologies of
            different sizes, from 40 triples to 750 triples. </li>
          <li><strong>Type/format:</strong> RDF/TURTLE, and html pages
            describing each ontology </li>
          <li><strong>Rate of change:</strong> Depends on the vocabulary, may
            depends on the different versions; although there is not such
            metadata information </li>
          <li><strong>Data lifespan:</strong> n/a </li>
          <li><strong>Potential audience:</strong> BBC applications and any user
            interested in the domains of the vocabularies (publishers,
            researchers or developers) </li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Challenges</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>It could be nice and consistent to add systematically the metadata
            provided in the html pages describing each BBC ontology in the RDF
            vocabulary. </li>
          <li>How to dereference from a unique URI, different versions of the
            ontology in different flavor of RDF (XML, TURTLE, etc.) </li>
          <li>Need to add the modified date along with the version of each

        <p> <a href="http://bio2rdf.org/">Bio2RDF</a><sup><a href="#bio1">1</a></sup>
          is an open source project that uses Semantic Web technologies to make
          possible the distributed querying of integrated life sciences data.
          Since its inception<sup><a href="#bio2">2</a></sup>, Bio2RDF has made
          use of the Resource Description Framework (RDF) and the RDF Schema
          (RDFS) to unify the representation of data obtained from diverse
          fields (molecules, enzymes, pathways, diseases, etc.) and
          heterogeneously formatted biological data (e.g. flat-files,
          tab-delimited files, SQL, dataset specific formats, XML etc.). Once
          converted to RDF, this biological data can be queried using the SPARQL
          Protocol and RDF Query Language (SPARQL), which can be used to
          federate queries across multiple SPARQL endpoints. </p>
        <p> <strong>Elements:</strong> </p>
        <ul>
          <li><b><i>Domains:</i></b> Biological data </li>
          <li><b><i>Obligation/motivation:</i></b> Biological researchers are
            often confronted with the inevitable and unenviable task of having
            to integrate their experimental results with those of others. This
            task usually involves a tedious manual search and assimilation of
            often isolated and diverse collections of life sciences data hosted
            by multiple independent providers including organizations such as
            the National Center for Bio-technology Information (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/">NCBI</a>)
            and the European Bioinformatics Institute (<a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/">EBI</a>)
            that provide dozens of user-submitted and curated datasets, as well
            as smaller institutions such as the Donaldson group that publishes <a

              href="http://irefindex.org/">iRefIndex</a><sup><a href="#bio3">3</a></sup>,
            a database of molecular interactions aggregated from 13 data
            sources. While these mostly isolated silos of biological information
            occasionally provide links between their records (e.g. <a href="http://www.uniprot.org">UniProt</a>
            links its entries to hundreds of other datasets), they are typically
            serialized in either HTML elements or in flat file data dumps that
            lack the semantic richness required to serialize the intent of the
            linkage between data records. With thousands of biological databases
            and hundreds of thousands of datasets, the ability to find relevant
            data is hampered by non-standard database interfaces and an enormous
            number of haphazard data formats<sup><a href="#bio4">4</a></sup>.
            Moreover, metadata about these biological data providers (dataset
            source data information, dataset versioning, licensing information,
            date of creation, etc.) is often difficult to obtain. Taken
            together, the inability to easily navigate through available data
            presents an overwhelming barrier to their reuse. </li>
          <li><b><i>Usage:</i></b> Biological research</li>
          <li><b><i>Quality:</i></b> Bio2RDF scripts generate provenance records
            using the <abbr title="World Wide Web Consortium">W3C</abbr>
            Vocabulary of Interlinked Datasets (<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/void/">VoID</a>),
            the Provenance vocabulary (<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/prov-overview/">PROV</a>)
            and <a href="http://dublincore.org/">Dublin Core</a> vocabulary.
            Each data item is linked to a provenance object that indicates the
            source of the data, the time at which the RDF was generated,
            licensing (if available from the data source provider), the SPARQL
            endpoint in which the resource can be found, and the downloadable
            RDF file where the data item is located. Each dataset provenance
            object has a unique IRI and label based on the dataset name and
            creation date. The date-specific dataset IRI is linked to a unique
            dataset IRI using the PROV predicate <code>wasDerivedFrom</code>
            such that one can query the dataset SPARQL endpoint to retrieve all
            provenance records for datasets created on different dates. Each
            resource in the dataset is linked the date-unique dataset IRI that
            is part of the provenance record using the VoID <code>inDataset</code>
            predicate. Other important features of the provenance record include
            the use of the Dublin Core <code>creator</code> term to link a
            dataset to the script on Github that was used to generate it, the
            VoID predicate <code>sparqlEndpoint</code> to point to the dataset
            SPARQL endpoint, and VoID predicate <code>dataDump</code> to point
            to the data download URL.

        <p>Buildingeye.com makes building and planning information easier to
          find and understand by mapping what's happening in your city. In
          Ireland local authorities handle planning applications and usually
          provide some customized views of the data (PDFs, maps, etc.) on their
          own Web site. However there isn't an easy way to get a nationwide view
          of the data. BuildingEye, an independent SME, built <a href="http://mypp.ie/">http://mypp.ie/</a>
          to achieve this. However as each local authority didn't have an Open
          Data portal, BuildingEye had to directly ask each local authority for
          its data. It was granted access to some authorities, but not all. The
          data it did receive was in different formats and of varying
          quality/detail. BuildingEye harmonized this data for its own system.
          However, if another SME wanted to use this data, they would have to go
          through the same process and again go to each local authority asking
          for the data. </p>

          archiving of Linked Data</h3>
        <p class="contributor">(Contributed by Christophe Guéret)<br />
          URL: <a href="http://dans.knaw.nl/">http://dans.knaw.nl/</a></p>
        <p>Digital archives, such as <abbr title="Data Archiving and Networked Services"><a

              href="http://dans.knaw.nl/">DANS</a></abbr> in the Netherlands,
          have so far been concerned with the preservation of what could be
          defined as "frozen" datasets. A frozen dataset is a finished,
          self-contained set of data that does not evolve after it has been
          constituted. The goal of the preserving institution is to ensure this
          dataset remains available and readable for as many years as possible.
          This can for example concern an audio recording, a digitized image,
          e-books or database dumps. Consumers of the data are expected to look
          for specific content based on its associated identifier, download it
          from the archive and use it. Now comes the question of the
          preservation of Linked Open Data. In opposition to "frozen" data sets,
          linked data can be qualified as "live" data. The resources it contains
          are part of a larger entity to which third parties contribute, one of
          the design principles indicate that other data producers and consumers
          should be able to point to data. As <abbr title="Linked Data">LD</abbr>
          publishers stop offering their data (e.g. at the end of a project),
          taking the LD off-line as a dump and putting it in an archive
          effectively turns it into a frozen dataset, likewise SQL dumps and
          other kind of databases. The question then is to what extent this is
          an issue.</p>
        <p> <strong>Challenges:</strong> The archive has to think about whether
          dereferencing for resources found in preserved datasets is required or
          not, also to think about providing a SPARQL endpoint or not. If data
          consumers and publishers are fine with having RDF data dumps to be
          downloaded from the archive prior to its usage - just like any other
          digital item so far - the technical challenges could be limited to
          handling the size of the dumps and taking care of serialization
          evolution over time (e.g. from N-Triples to TriG, or from RDF/XML to <a

            href="http://www.rdfhdt.org/">HDT</a>) as the preference for these
          formats evolves. Turning a live dataset into a frozen dump also raises
          the question of the scope. Considering that LD items are only part of
          a much larger graph that gives them meaning through context the only
          valid dump would be a complete snapshot of the entire connected
          component of the Web of Data graph the target dataset is part of. </p>
        <p> <strong>Potential Requirements:</strong> Decide on the importance
          of the de-referencability of resources and the potential implications
          for domain names and naming of resources. Decide on the scope of the
          step that will turn a connected sub-graph into an isolated data dump.</p>

          Registers</h3>

        <p> The Netherlands has a <a href="http://e-overheid.nl/onderwerpen/stelselinformatiepunt/stelsel-van-basisregistraties/basisregistraties">
            set of registers</a> that are under consideration for exposure as
          Linked (Open) Data in the context of the <a href="http://www.pilod.nl/wiki/Hoofdpagina">"PiLOD"</a>
          project. The registers contain information about buildings, people,
          businesses that other individual public bodies may want to refer to
          for they daily activities. One of them is, for instance, the service
          of public taxes ("BelastingDienst") which regularly pulls out data
          from several registers, stores this data in a big Oracle instance and
          curates it. This costly and time consuming process could be optimized
          by providing on-demand access to up-to-date descriptions provided by
          the register owners.</p>
        <p> <strong>Challenges:</strong> </p>
        In terms of challenges, linking is for once not much of an issue as <a

          href="http://www.e-overheid.nl/onderwerpen/stelselinformatiepunt/stelselthemas/verbindingen/verbindingen-tussen-basisregistraties">
          registers already cross-reference unique identifiers</a> (see also <a

          href="http://www.wikixl.nl/wiki/gemma/index.php/Ontsluiting_basisgegevens">
          http://www.wikixl.nl/wiki/gemma/index.php/Ontsluiting_basisgegevens</a>).
        A <a href="http://www.pilod.nl/wiki/Boek/URI-strategie">URI scheme</a>
        with predicable and persistent URIs is being considered for
        implementation. Actual challenges include:
        <ul>
          <li>Capacity: at this point, it is considered unreasonable to ask
            every register to publish its own data. Some of them export what
            they have on the national open data portal. This data has been used
            to do some testing with third-party publications from PiLOD project
            members but this is rather sensitive as a long term strategy
            (governmental data has to be traceable/trustable as such). The middle
            ground solution currently deployed is the PiLOD platform, a
            (semi)-official platform for publishing register data.</li>
          <li>Privacy: some of the register data is personal or may become so
            when linked to others (e.g. when addresses are used to disambiguate
            personal data). Some registers will require secure access to some of
            their data to some people only (an example of non-open Linked Data).
            Some others can go along with open data as long as they get a
            precise log of who is using what.</li>
          <li>Revenue: institutions working under mixed
            government/non-government funding generate part of their revenue by
            selling some of the data they curate. Switching to an open data
            model will cause a direct loss in revenue that has to be compensated
            for by other means. This does not have to mean closing the data,
            e.g. a model of open dereferencing plus paid dumps can be
            considered, as well as other indirect revenue streams. </li>

        <p>Retailers and Manufacturers / Brand Owners are beginning to
          understand that there can be benefits to openly publishing structured
          data about products and product offerings on the Web as Linked Open
          Data. Some of the initial benefits may be enhanced search listing
          results (e.g. Google Rich Snippets) that improve the likelihood of
          consumers choosing such a product or product offer over an alternative
          product that lacks the enhanced search results. However, the longer
          term vision is that an ecosystem of new product-related services can
          be enabled if such data is available. Many of these will be
          consumer-facing and might be accessed via smartphones and other mobile
          devices, to help consumers to find the products and product offers
          that best match their search criteria and personal preferences or
          needs — and to alert them if a particular product is incompatible with
          their dietary preferences or other criteria such as ethical /
          environmental impact considerations — and to suggest an alternative
          product that may be a more suitable match. A more <a href="https://www.w3.org/2013/dwbp/wiki/Use_Cases#GS1:_GS1_Digital">complete
            description</a> of this use case is available.</p>
        <p><strong>Elements:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><b><i>Domains:</i></b>
            <ul>
              <li>Product master data (e.g. technical specifications,
                ingredients, nutritional information, dimensions, weight,
                packaging).</li>
              <li>Product offerings (e.g. sales price, availability (online,
                locally), payment options, delivery/collection options.</li>
              <li>Ethical / environmental claims about a product and its
                production process.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><b><i>Obligation/motivation:</i></b>
            <ul>
              <li>initially, enhanced search result listings (e.g. Google Rich
                Snippets);</li>
              <li>vision is to enable an ecosystem of new digital apps around
                product data;</li>
              <li>the food sector in the EU is already obliged under new food
                labelling legislation (EU 1169 / 2011, Article 14) to provide
                the same amount of information about a food product that is sold
                online to consumers as the information that would be available
                to them from the product packaging if they picked up the product
                in-store. Although the legislation does not suggest that Linked
                Open Data technology should be used to make the same information
                available in a machine-readable format, there is currently
                significant investment and effort to upgrade Web sites to
                provide accurate and detailed information about food products;
                the GS1 Digital team consider that for a relatively small amount
                of effort, these companies could gain some tangible benefits
                (e.g. enhanced search results) from such compliance efforts by
                using Linked Open Data technology within their Web pages.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><b><i>Usage:</i></b>
            <ul>
              <li>data providing transparency about product characteristics</li>
              <li>data used to help consumers make informed choices about which
                products to buy/consume</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><b><i>Quality:</i></b> Very important to have trustworthy
            authoritative data from respective organizations.</li>
          <li><b><i>Size:</i></b> Typically 20+ factual claims per product -
            probably 40+ RDF triples.</li>
          <li><b><i>Type/format:</i></b> HTML + RDFa / JSON-LD / Microdata.</li>
          <li><b><i>Rate of change:</i></b> mostly static data initially — but
            subject to some variation over time</li>
          <li><b><i>Data lifespan:</i></b> data should remain accessible until
            products are no longer considered to be in circulation; this
            represents a challenge for deprecated product lines data that is
            stated authoritatively by one organization might be embedded /
            referenced in the data asserted by another organization; this raises
            concerns about whether embedded data becomes stale if it is
            inadequately synchronized, that referenced data is not dereferenced
            (and therefore not discovered / gathered) by consumers or the data.
            From a liability perspective, there also needs to be clarity about
            which organization asserted which factual information — and also
            information about which organization has the authority to assert
            specific factual claims.</li>
          <li><b><i>Potential audience:</i></b> machine-readable (search
            engines, data aggregators, mobile apps etc.)</li>
        </ul>
        <p> <strong>Challenges:</strong> </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Linked Open Data about products is likely to be highly distributed
            in nature and various parties have authority over specific claims.</li>
          <li>Accreditation agencies have authority over ethical/environmental
            claims.</li>
          <li>Brand owners / manufacturers have authority over product master
            data.</li>
          <li>Retailers have authority over facts related to product offerings
            (price, availability etc.).</li>
          <li>An organization (e.g. retailer) might embed authoritative data
            asserted by another organization (e.g. brand owner) and there is the
            risk that such embedded information becomes stale if it is not
            continuously synchronized.</li>
          <li>An organization (e.g. retailer) might reference a graph of
            authoritative data that can be retrieved via an HTTP request to a
            remote HTTP URI. There is a risk that software or search engines
            consuming Linked Open Data containing such references may fail to
            dereference such HTTP URIs and in doing so may fail to gather all of
            the relevant data.</li>
          <li>Organizations are currently faced with a choice of whether to
            embed machine-readable structured data in their Web pages using a
            block approach (e.g. using JSON-LD) or using an inline approach
            (e.g. using RDFa, RDFa Lite or Microdata). A block approach
            (JSON-LD) may be simpler and less brittle than inline annotation,
            especially as it can be easily decoupled from structural changes to
            the body of the Web page that may happen over time in the redesign
            of a Web site. At present, tool support for the 3 major markup
            approaches for embedded Linked Open Data (RDFa, JSON-LD, Microdata)
            is unequal across the three formats and some tools may not export or
            import / ingest all 3 formats - some tools even fail to extract data
            from JSON-LD markup created by their corresponding export tool.
            There are some significant challenges to ensure that the structured
            data embedded within a Web page is correctly linked to form coherent
            RDF triples, without any dangling nodes that should be connected to
            the Subject or other nodes.</li>
          <li>Only through the provision of best-in-class tool support that
            recognize all three major formats on a completely equal footing can
            organizations have any confidence that they can use any of the 3
            major markup formats and the ability to verify / validate that their
            own markup does result in the correct RDF triples.</li>
        </ul>
        <p> <strong>Potential Requirements:</strong> </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The ability to determine who asserted various facts — and whether
            they are the organization that can assert those facts
            authoritatively.</li>
          <li>Where data from other sources is embedded, there is a risk that
            the embedded data might be stale. It is therefore helpful to
            indicate which graph of triples is a snapshot in time from data from
            another source - and to provide a link to the original source, so
            that the consumer of the data has the opportunity to obtain a fresh
            version of the live data rather than relying on a potentially stale
            snapshot graph of data. <abbr title="Data on the Web Best Practices">DWBP</abbr>
            could provide guidance about how to indicate which graph of data is
            a snapshot and where it came from.</li>
          <li>Consumers of Linked Open Data about products might rely on it for
            making decisions — not only about purchase but even consumption. If
            the data about a product is inaccurate or out-of-date, we might need
            to provide some guidance about how liability terms and disclaimers
            can be expressed in Linked Open Data. We’re not suggesting that we
            define such terms from a legal perspective, but perhaps there is an
            existing framework in a similar way that there is an existing
            framework for expressing various licences of the data? If not,
            perhaps such a framework needs to be developed - but outside of the
            DWBP group? Licensing generally says what you’re allowed to do with
            the data - but I don’t think it says anything about liability for
            using the data or making decisions based on that data. This area
            probably needs some clarification, particularly if there is a risk
            of injury or death (due to inaccurate information about allergens in
            a food product).</li>

        <p> ISO GEO manages catalog records of geographic information in XML

          they need to manage them better. In their platform, they store the

          export datasets compliant to the <a href="http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/">INSPIRE</a>

          of Ron Galperin's Infographic</h3>
        <p class="contributor">(Contributed by Phil Archer )<br />
          URL: <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2014/mar/27/local/la-me-ln-gender-wage-gap-city-government-20140327">http://articles.latimes.com/2014/mar/27/local/la-me-ln-gender-wage-gap-city-government-20140327</a></p>
        <p> On 27 March 2014, the LA Times published a story <i>Women earn 83
            cents for every $1 men earn in L.A. city government</i>. It was
          based on an Infographic released by LA's City Controller, Ron
          Galperin. The Infographic was based on a dataset published on LA's
          open data portal, <a href="https://controllerdata.lacity.org/Payroll/Gender-Breakdown-of-City-Workers-by-Category/fvfi-5kja">
            Control Panel LA</a> . That portal uses the <a href="http://www.socrata.com/">Socrata</a>
          platform which offers a number of spreadhseet-like tools for examining
          the data, the ability to download it as CSV, embed it in a Web page
          and see its metadata.</p>
        <p> <strong>Positive aspects:</strong> </p>
        <ul>
          <li> The LA Times story makes its sources clear (it also links to a
            related <a href="http://www.pewsocialtrends.org/2013/12/11/on-pay-gap-millennial-women-near-parity-for-now/">
              Pew Research Center article</a> ). </li>
          <li>It offers readers a commentary on the particular issue raised and
            is easy for anyone to digest.</li>
          <li>Data sources are cited directly and can be followed up on by
            (human) readers.</li>
        </ul>
        <p> <strong>Negative aspects:</strong> </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The Infographic itself only cites the <a href="https://controllerdata.lacity.org/">data
              portal</a>, not the <a href="https://controllerdata.lacity.org/Payroll/Gender-Breakdown-of-City-Workers-by-Category/fvfi-5kja">specific
              dataset</a>.</li>
          <li> The <a href="https://controllerdata.lacity.org/Payroll/Gender-Breakdown-of-City-Workers-by-Category/fvfi-5kja/about">
              metadata</a> provided on the data portal is very sparse with many
            fields left empty. </li>
          <li>The dataset is itself the result of an analysis (there are only 8
            lines in the table), the raw data on which it is based is not cited,
            let alone made available, and the methods used are not described.</li>
        </ul>
        <p> <strong>Challenges:</strong> </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Data Citation - how could Ron Galperin have referred to the source
            data in the Infographic? (the URI is way too long). QR code? Short
            PURL?</li>
          <li>How could the publisher of the data link to the Infographic as a
            visualization of it?</li>
          <li>In this case, the creator of the underlying data is the same as
            the creator of the Infographic, but if they were different, how
            could the data creator discover the Infographic, still less the
            media report about it?</li>
          <li>The methodology used is not explained - making it hard to assess
            trustworthiness. How can provenance be described?</li>
          <li>The metadata is incomplete and does not used a recognized standard
            vocabulary making automated discovery and use by anyone other than
            the data creator difficult.</li>

        <h3 id="h3_UC-LusTRE" role="heading" aria-level="2">LusTRE: Linked
          Thesaurus fRamework for Environment</h3>
        <p class="contributor">(Contributed by Riccardo Albertoni, CNR-IMATI,
          Genoa, Italy)<br />
          URL: <a href="http://linkeddata.ge.imati.cnr.it/">http://linkeddata.ge.imati.cnr.it/</a></p>
        <p>LusTRE is a framework that combines existing thesauri to support the
          management of environmental resources. It considers the heterogeneity
          in scope and levels of abstraction of existing environmental thesauri
          as an asset when managing environmental data, thus it exploits Linked
          Data (<abbr title="Simple Knowledge Organisation System">SKOS</abbr>,
          <abbr title="Resource Description Framework">RDF</abbr> etc.) in order
          to provide a multi-thesauri solution for <abbr title="Infrastructure for Spatial Information in the European Community"><a

              href="http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/">INSPIRE</a></abbr> data themes
          related to nature conservation.</p>
        <p>LusTRE is intended to support metadata compilation and data/service
          discovery according to ISO 19115/19119. The development of LusTRE
          includes:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type:lower-roman">
          <li>a review of existing environmental thesauri and their
            characteristics in term of multilingualism, openness and quality;</li>
          <li>the publication of environmental thesauri as Linked Data;</li>
          <li>the creation of linksets among published thesauri as well as
            well-known thesauri exposed as Linked Data by third-parties;</li>
          <li>the exploitation of aforementioned linksets to take advantage of
            thesaurus complementarities in terms of domain specificity and
            multilingualism.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Quality of thesauri and linksets is an issue that is not necessarily
          limited to the initial review of thesauri, it should be monitored and
          promptly documented. </p>
        <p>In this respect, a standardized vocabulary for expressing dataset and
          linkset quality would be needed to make accessible the quality
          assessment of thesauri included in LusTRE. Considering the importance
          of linkset quality in the achievement of an effective cross-walking
          among thesauri, further services for assessing the quality of linksets
          are going to be investigated. Such services might be developed
          extending the measure proposed in <a href="http://www.edbt.org/Proceedings/2013-Genova/papers/workshops/a8-albertoni.pdf">Albertoni
            et al, 2013</a> (PDF), so that, linksets among thesauri can be
          assessed considering their potential when exploiting interlinks for
          thesaurus complementarities.</p>
        <p>LusTRE is currently under development within the EU project eENVplus
          (CIP-ICT-PSP grant No. 325232), it extends the common thesaurus
          framework <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1107.1676">De Martino et al.
            2011</a> previously resulting from the EU project NatureSDIplus
          (ECP-2007-GEO-317007).</p>
        <p><strong>Elements:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Domains:</strong> Geographic information. Thesauri and
            Controlled vocabularies provided within LusTRE's are meant to ease
            the management of Geographical Data and Services.</li>
          <li><strong>Obligation/motivation:</strong> Activity foreseen in EU
            project which encourages the adoption of INSPIRE metadata
            implementation rules.</li>
          <li><strong>Usage:</strong> Data that is the basis for services to the
            public.</li>
          <li><strong>Quality:</strong> Largely variable.</li>
          <li><strong>Lineage:</strong> Thesauri and controlled vocabulary
            provided come from third parties.</li>
          <li><strong>Size:</strong> Small,  most of the thesauri size is less
            than 100MB.</li>
          <li><strong>Type/format:</strong> LusTRE publishes SKOS/RDF, but the
            thesauri considered for inclusion in LusTRE are not necessarily in
            that format.</li>
          <li><strong>Rate of change:</strong> Depends on the thesaurus, in
            average it is a low rate of Change.</li>
          <li><strong>Data lifespan:</strong> Beyond the lifespan of eENVPlus
            project (2013 – 2015).</li>
          <li><strong>Potential audience:</strong> Public administrations
            involved in the cataloguing of geographical information and Spatial
            Data Infrastructure. Decision makers searching in Spatial Data
            Infrastructure.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Positive aspects:</strong> The use case includes publication
          as well as consumptions of data.</p>
        <p><strong>Challenges:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Diversity and (sometimes) complexity of Licenses.</li>

        <p> There are many different <a href="http://opendefinition.org/licenses/">licenses</a>
          available under which data can be published on the Web, e.g. <a href="http://creativecommons.org/">Creative
            Commons</a>, <a href="http://opendatacommons.org/">Open Data
            Commons</a>, national licenses, etc. It is important that the
          license is available in a machine-readable format. Leigh Dodds has
          done some work towards this with the <a href="http://schema.theodi.org/odrs/">Open
            Data Rights Statement Vocabulary</a> including guides for <a href="http://theodi.org/guides/publishers-guide-to-the-open-data-rights-statement-vocabulary">publishers</a>
          and <a href="http://theodi.org/guides/odrs-reusers-guide">reusers</a>.
          Another issue is when data under different licenses are combined, the
          license terms under which the data is available also have to be
          merged. This interoperability of licenses is a challenge.</p>
        <p> <strong>Challenges:</strong> </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Standard vocabulary for data licenses.</li>

          Imaging (MSI)</h3>
        <p class="contributor">(Contributed by Annette Greiner, Lawrence
          Berkeley National Laboratory, California)<br />
          URL: <a href="https://openmsi.nersc.gov/">https://openmsi.nersc.gov/</a></p>
        <p>Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) is widely applied to image complex
          samples for applications spanning health, microbial ecology, and high
          throughput screening of high-density arrays. MSI has emerged as a
          technique suited to resolving metabolism within complex cellular
          systems; where understanding the spatial variation of metabolism is
          vital for making a transformative impact on science. Unfortunately,
          the scale of MSI data and complexity of analysis presents an
          insurmountable barrier to scientists where a single 2D-image may be
          many gigabytes and comparison of multiple images is beyond the
          capabilities available to most scientists. The OpenMSI project will
          overcome these challenges, allowing broad use of MSI to researchers by
          providing a Web-based gateway for management and storage of MSI data,
          the visualization of the hyper-dimensional contents of the data, and
          the statistical analysis.</p>
        <p><strong>Elements:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Domains:</strong> imaging mass spectrometry, life
            sciences, microscopy, analytical chemistry.</li>
          <li><strong>Obligation/motivation:</strong> scientific analysis,
            reporting results, collaboration</li>
          <li><strong>Usage:</strong> Data sets can be contributed by
            researchers anywhere in the world and perused/analyzed by anyone.
            Users can share their data with individuals and the public using a
            familiar group and users view/edit/own permission scheme. Once their
            dataset is in the system, a researcher can select subsets of the
            data for viewing as an image or spectrum. Researchers can perform
            statistical analysis of their data, e.g, via non-negative matrix
            factorization, while the API and online viewers enable users to
            interact with derived analytics in the same way as with raw data.
            Users can also download individual images. A REST API provides
            programmatic access to enable custom remote data analytics and
            retrieval of data subsets.</li>
          <li><strong>Quality:</strong> varies with mass spectrometry instrument
            used, preparation of sample.</li>
          <li><strong>Size:</strong> Average sizes typically range from 10-50 GB
            per sample (before compression). Larger images of 50 - 500GB can
            already be generated today. Each lab with an OpenMSI account
            generates typically 2-5 samples per week.</li>
          <li><strong>Type/format:</strong> Multiscale, multimodal, and
            multidimensional data stored using the OpenMSI file format based on
            HDF5.</li>
          <li><strong>Rate of change:</strong> Underlying data for an experiment
            does not generally change, though new analyses and metadata will be
            added over time.</li>
          <li><strong>Data lifespan:</strong> years to decades.</li>
          <li><strong>Potential audience:</strong> working scientists interested
            in obtaining spatially resolved chemical information about samples
            including scientists researching cancer, agriculture, and synthetic
            biology.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Positive aspects:</strong> huge improvement in ease of
          analysis over traditional methods, ability to readily share results
          with other researchers, ability to download relevant subsets of data,
          provides metadata for each sample, self-describing data format, fast
          and flexible Web API, interactive Web-based exploration that enables
          user to view data that cannot be opened using standard MSI tools.</p>
        <p><strong>Negative aspects:</strong> submission of metadata should be
          easier and automated. As it scales, we'll need to facilitate discovery
          of datasets of interest via search. </p>
        <p><strong>Challenges:</strong> Project is largely unfunded and
          resources are vitally needed for project to succeed.</p>

          and social equity. Accordingly, transport data — largely produced or
          gathered by public sector organisations or semi-private entities, quite
          often locally — represents one of the most valuable sources of public
          sector information (PSI, also called ‘open data’), a key policy area
          for many, including the European Commission.</p>
        <p>The Challenge: Combined with the advancement of Web technologies and
          the increasing use of smart phones, the demand for high quality
          machine-readable and openly licensed transport data, allowing for
          reuse in commercial and non-commercial products and services, is
          rising rapidly. Unfortunately this demand is not met by current
          supply: many transport data producers and holders (from the public and
          private sectors) have not managed to respond adequately to these new
          challenges set by society and technology.</p>
        <p>So what do we need?</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Access to any transport data of any operator, of high quality, in
            real time, against free or at least fair standard conditions.</li>
          <li>An inclusive infrastructure, based on common open,
            non-discriminatory and interoperable standards and APIs, to which
            operators, service providers, developers and users can connect.</li>
          <li>An ecosystem wherein universal access and re-usability of transport
            data is the rule, not the exception.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Why is this not happening?</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Data that is necessary for integrated personal transportation
            solutions is rich and encompasses several domains (geospatial data,
            environmental data, private service provider data), involving a wide
            array of data holders from the public and private sectors. Because
            of its very nature, transport data is often held locally.</li>
          <li>Legacies create lock-ins that prevent adoption of open standards
            and hamper interoperability. </li>
          <li>Many operators and incumbent service providers, in particular
            those relying on income from sales of data, still regard selective
            and exclusive access to transport data as a competitive advantage,
            restricting access and reuse through the exercise of intellectual
            property rights.</li>
          <li>Perceived liability risks, often associated with data quality
            issues, prevent operators from opening up their data.</li>
          <li>Significant differences between countries, regions and transport
            modalities in terms of level of development, market maturity and
            associated business models prevent a ‘one size fits all’ solution.</li>
          <li>A lack of leadership in the value chain, either by the industry or
            from the authorities (whatever the level), limits governance
            capabilities as to establishment of access, accessibility and other
            framework conditions, creating a need for a subtle mix of mostly
            bottom-up instruments and a dash of top-down measures.</li>
          <li>Existing market players with associated interests turn
            governmental actions into a delicate matter, in particular as to the
            question of where the role of the government should start and end
            within the value chain and where the market parties should take over
            and become the driving factor.</li>
          <li>Where market parties need to step in, the lack of a clear and
            predictable environment prevents businesses from establishing a
            long-term perspective, whereby fair competition needs to be
            safeguarded.</li>

        <p>The Open City Data Pipeline aims to provide an extensible platform
          to support citizens and city administrators by providing city key
          performance indicators (KPIs), leveraging open data sources. An
          assumption of open data is that “Added value comes from comparable
          open datasets being combined.” Open data needs stronger standards to
          be useful, in particular for industrial uptake. Industrial usage has
          different requirements than that of an application-building hobbyist
          or civil society so it's important to think how open data can be used
          by industry at the time of publication. The Open City Data Pipeline
          project has developed a data pipeline to:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>(semi-)automatically collect and integrate various open data
            sources in different formats;</li>
          <li>compose and calculate complex city KPIs from the collected data.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Current Data Summary</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Ca. 475 different indicators </li>
          <li>Categories: Demography, Geography, Social Aspects, Economy,
            Environment, etc. </li>
          <li>from 32 sources (html, CSV, RDF …) </li>
          <li>Wikipedia, urbanaudit.org, Statistics from City homepages, country
            Statistics, iea.org.</li>
          <li>Covering 350+cities in 28 European countries.</li>
          <li>District data for selected cities (Vienna, Berlin).</li>
          <li>Mostly snapshots, partially covering timelines.</li>
          <li>On average ca. 285 facts per city.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Base assumption (for our use case): Added value comes from comparable

        <p>Challenges &amp; Lessons Learnt:</p>
        <ul>
          <li> <b>Incomplete</b> Data: can be partially overcome by:
            <ul>
              <li>ontological reasoning (RDF &amp; OWL), by aggregation, or by
                rules &amp; equations, e.g. <code>:populationDensity =
                  :population/:area</code>;</li>
              <li>By statistical methods or Multi-dimensional Matrix
                Decomposition (unfortunately only partially successful, because
                these algorithms assume normally-distributed data).</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><b>Incomparable</b> data:
            <ul>
              <li><code>dbpedia:populationTotal</code></li>
              <li><code>dbpedia:populationCensus</code></li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><b>Heterogeneity</b> across open government data efforts:
            <ul>
              <li>different <b>indicators</b>, different temporal and spatial
                granularity;</li>
              <li>different <b>licenses</b> of open data: e.g. CC-BY, country
                specific licences, etc. </li>

          <li>Open data needs stronger standards to be useful (in particular for

        <p class="contributor">(Contributed by Eric Stephan)</p>
        <p>In 2013 the United States Whitehouse published an executive order on
          Open Data to help make publically available data: understandable,
          accessible, and searchable. A number of historical and on-going
          atmospheric studies fall into this category but are not currently
          open. This use case describes characteristics of laboratory
          experiments and field studies that could be published as open data.</p>
        <p>For measurements to be considered useful and comparable to other
          findings scientists need to track every aspect of their laboratory and
          field experiments. This can include: background describing the purpose
          of the experiment, field site selected, instrumentation deployed,
          configuration settings, house keeping data, types of measurements that
          need to be taken, work performed on field visits, processing the raw
          measurements, intermediate processing data, value added data products,
          quality assurance, problem reporting, and standards relied upon for
          disseminating the study results including selected data formats,
          quality control codes selected, engineering units selected, and
          metadata vocabularies relied upon for describing the measurements.</p>
        <p>Traditionally knowledge and data about the studies have either been
          kept in separate local databases, file systems and spreadsheets, or in
          non-record keeping systems. If kept electronically the experiment in
          its entirety may be kept in bulk by way of archive files (tar, zip
          etc). Measurements from the study may be shared along with background
          information in the form of a summarized report or publication, content
          management system or wiki site and the bulk of knowledge is largely
          retained internally by data providers. </p>
        <p><strong>Elements: </strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Domains:</strong> Open scientific experimental research
            relying upon in situ and remote sensing instruments. E.g. wind
            studies that may use anemometers and Lidar to study wind
            measurements.</li>
          <li><strong>Obligation/motivation:</strong> Answer scientific
            questions about the characteristics and behavior of the physical
            system being studied.</li>
          <li><strong>Usage:</strong> Data may analyzed and visualized by
            applications, used in computational models or combined in larger
            data sets for larger studies.</li>
          <li><strong>Quality:</strong> House keeping data, problem reporting,
            maintenance history, calibration history.</li>
          <li><strong>Size:</strong> Dependent on the length of the study,
            measurement rate, and the size of each sample. Size can vary from
            kilobytes to tens of gigabytes daily for a single instrument.</li>
          <li><strong>Type/format:</strong> raw data is dictated by the
            instrument producing the measurements. Intermediate results and
            value added products can be in binary, delimited text file, NetCDF,
            or stored in other formats.</li>
          <li><strong>Rate of change:</strong> depends on the measurement rate.</li>
          <li><strong>Data lifespan:</strong> This may vary between scientific
            communities. For atmosphere field studies data cannot be reproduced
            and may be retained forever. If a laboratory experiment can be
            repeated, it may have a limited lifespan. In cases where data is
            cited even repeatable experiments will be available to back up the
            published research findings.</li>
          <li><strong>Potential audience:</strong> domain experts and scientific
            peers, science teachers and students. Other domains will use these
            results.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Positive aspects:</strong> The Web of Things (instruments),
          Linked Services (processing software), and Linked Data communities
          offer an opportunity to field or laboratory experiments by coupling
          all the elements of the experiment into one composite product.
          Leveraging these technologies it is possible to construct a catalog
          that acts as a concierge to any collaborator giving them perspectives
          on things, services, and data.</p>
        <p><strong>Negative aspects:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>When data is published on the Web there is no mechanism for users
            to rate and review data.</li>
          <li>Data providers usually are unaware of new user communities using
            measurements.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Challenges:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Publishing experiments to publically accessible Web-based
            archives.</li>
          <li>Advertising experiments in catalogs that includes comprehensive
            information about the things and services used in the experiment.</li>
          <li>Providing composite experiment in such a way that it is useful to
            users that are not fellow collaborators.</li>
          <li>Identifying new emerging target user communities</li>
          <li>Without specific best practices guidance data may not be published
            and irreproducible data risks being lost.</li>
          <li>Policies need to be provided when in the experimental design when
            it is acceptable to publish data and when to keep it initially
            private.</li>

          for Extreme Scale Collaboration (RDESC)</h3>
        <p class="contributor">(Contributed by Sumit Purohit)<br />
          URL: <a href="http://rdesc.org/">http://rdesc.org/</a></p>
        <p>RDESC's objective is to develop a capability for describing, linking,
          searching and discovering scientific resources used in collaborative
          science. For the purpose of capturing semantic context, RDESC adopts
          sets of existing ontologies where possible such as <a href="http://xmlns.com/foaf/spec/"><abbr

              title="Friend of a Friend">FOAF</abbr></a>, <a href="http://bibliontology.com/"><abbr

              title="The Bibliographic Ontology">BIBO</abbr></a> and <a href="http://schema.org">schema.org</a>.
          RDESC also introduced new concepts in order to provide a semantically
          integrated view of the data. Such concepts have two distinct
          functions. The first is to preserve the semantics of the source that
          are more specific than what already existed in the ontology. The
          second is to provide broad categorization of existing concepts as it
          becomes clear that concepts are forming general groups. These
          generalizations enable users to work with concepts they understand,
          rather than needing to understand the semantics of many different
          systems. It strives to provide a lightweight enough framework to be
          used as a component in any software system such as desktop user
          environments or dashboards but also be scalable to millions of
          resources.</p>

        <p>Recife is a city situated in the Northeast of Brazil and it is famous
          for being one of the Brazil’s biggest tech hubs. Recife is also one of
          the first Brazilian cities to release data generated by public sector
          organizations for public use as open data. Then <a href="http://dados.recife.pe.gov.br/">Open
            Data Portal Recife </a> was created to offer access to a repository
          of governmental machine-readable data about several domains,
          including: finances, health, education and tourism. Data is available
          in CSV and GeoJSON formats and every dataset has metadata that helps
          in the understanding and usage of the data. However, the metadata is
          not provided using standard vocabularies or taxonomies. In general,
          data is created in a static way, where data from relational databases
          are exported in a CSV format and then published in the data catalog.
          Currently, work is under way to dynamically generate data from
          relational databases so that data will be available as soon as it is
          created. The main phases of the development of this initiative were:
          to educate people with appropriate knowledge concerning open data,
          relevant data identification in order to identify the sources of data
          that their potential consumers could find useful, data extraction and
          transformation from the original data sources to open formats,
          configuration and installation of the open data catalog tool, data
          publication and portal release.</p>

        <p> <strong>Negative Aspects:</strong> the data is already outdated (in

        <p>The <a href="http://www.w3.org/2013/share-psi/">Share-PSI 2.0
            Thematic Network</a>, co funded by the European Commission, is
          running a series of workshops throughout 2014 and 2015 examining
          different aspects of how to share Public Sector Information (PSI).
          This is in the context of the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/legal-rules">revised
            European Directive on the Public Sector Information</a>. The
          network's focus is therefore slightly different than Data on the Web

          overlap is substantial. There are more than 40 partners in the
          Share-PSI 2.0 network from 25 countries including many government
          departments as well as academics, consultants, citizen's organizations

        <p>Tabul.ae is a framework to publish and visually explore data that can
          used to deploy powerful and easy-to-exploit open data platforms, so
          allowing organizations to unleash the potential of their data. The aim
          is to enable data owners (public organizations) and consumers
          (citizens and business reusers) to transform the information they
          manage into added-value knowledge, empowering them to easily create
          data-centric Web applications. These applications are built upon
          interactive and powerful graphs, and take the shape of interactive
          charts, dashboards, infographics and reports. Tabulae provides a high
          degree of assistance to create these apps and also automate several
          data visualization tasks (e.g. recognition of geographical entities to
          automatically generate a map). In addition, the charts and maps are
          portable outside the platform and can be smartly integrated with any
          Web content, enhancing the reusability of the information.</p>

        <p>In 2013, the <a href="http://royalsociety.org/">Royal Society</a>
          lead the formation of the <a href="http://www.researchinfonet.org/research-data/open-research-data-forum/">UK

          of a global trend towards the open publication of research data; see,
          for instance, the work of the <a href="http://rd-alliance.org/">Research
            Data Alliance</a>, <a href="http://datacite.org/">DataCite</a> and

          Bourne. Following a workshop in April 2014, the UK Open Research Data
          Forum and US Committee on Coherence at Scale issued a <a href="http://www.researchinfonet.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Joint-statement-of-principles-June-2014.pdf">joint
            statement</a> (PDF) of the principles of open research data.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>The data that provide the evidence for the concepts in a published
            paper or its equivalent, together with the relevant metadata and
            computer code must be concurrently available for scrutiny and
            consistent with the criteria of “intelligent openness”. The data
            must be:
            <ul>
              <li>discoverable – readily found to exist by online search;</li>
              <li>accessible – when discovered they can be interrogated;</li>
              <li>intelligible – they can be understood;</li>
              <li>assessable – e.g. the provenance and reliability of data;</li>
              <li>reuseable – they can be reused and re-combined with other
                data.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>The data generated by publicly - or charitably - funded research
            that is not used as evidence for a published scientific concept
            should also be made intelligently open after a pre-specified period
            in which originators have exclusive access.</li>
          <li>Those who reuse data but were not their orginators must formally
            acknowledge their originators.</li>
          <li>The cost of creating intelligently open data from a research
            project is an intrinsic part of the cost of research, and should not
            be considered as an optional extra.</li>
          <li>Although the default position for data generated by publicly - or
            charitably -- funded research should be one of “intelligent
            openness”, there are justifiable limits to openness. These are where
            commercial exploitation is in the public interest and the sectoral
            business model requires limitations on openness; in preserving the
            privacy of individuals whose personal information is contained in
            databases; where data release would endanger safety (unintended
            accidents) or security (deliberate attack). However, these instances
            do not provide justification for blanket exceptions to the default
            position for those researchers or research institutions whose role
            is to disseminate openly their finding, and should be argued on a
            case- by case basis.</li>
          <li>Existing processes, reward structures and norms of behavior that
            inhibit or prevent data sharing or new forms of open collaboration
            should, wherever possible, be reformed so that data sharing and
            collaboration are encouraged, facilitated and rewarded.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>At the time of writing, these are undergoing review and refinement
          but the aims are clear. In the context of the Data on the Web Best
          Practices Working Group, many requirements stem from this list.</p>
        <p><strong>Challenges</strong></p>
        <p>Each principle listed here represents one or more challenges, with
          points 1, 3 and 5, being particularly relevant to Data on the Web Best
          Practices. Matters of policy and culture within any domain, whilst
          certainly challenging, are out of scope for the current work.</p>

          Open Data Catalog</h3>
        <p class="contributor">(Contributed by AGESIC )<br />
          URL: <a href="http://datauy.org/">http://datauy.org/</a></p>
        <p><a href="http://datauy.org/">Uruguay's open data portal</a> was
          launched in December 2012 and at the time of writing holds 85 datasets
          containing 114 resources. The open data initiative prioritizes the
          “use of data” rather than “quantity of data”, that’s why the catalog
          also promotes a number of applications using data resources in some
          way (in common with many other data portals). It’s important for the
          project to keep the ratio 1:3 between applications and datasets. Most
          of the resources are CSV and ESRI Shapefiles making this a catalog of
          2 and 3 star resources according to the <a href="http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/LinkedData">5
            Stars of Linked Open Data</a> scheme. AGESIC does not have
          sufficient resources at government agencies to implement an open data
          liberation strategy and go to the next level. So when we are asked
          about opening data, keep it simple is the answer, and CSV is by far
          the easiest and smart way to start. Uruguay has an access to public
          information law but doesn't have legislation about open data. The open
          data initiative is lead by AGESIC with the support of an open data
          working group drawn from multiple government agencies.</p>

        <p><strong>Overview: </strong>There are almost 65 million Brazilians
          connected to the Internet - 3 6% of the Brazilian Population,
          according to Comitê Gestor da Internet no Brasil. As a consequence,
          events such as the Brazilian Election Running have become popular
          topics in the Web, mainly in Online Social Networks. Our goal is to
          understand this new reality and present new ways to watch facts,
          events and entities on the fly using the Web and user-generated
          content available in Online Social Networks and Blogs. The Web
          Observatory is a research project part of the Instituto Nacional de
          Ciência e Tecnologia para a Web (INWEB), sponsored by CNPq and
          Fapemig. There are over 30 experts involved in the project, from four
          differente Federal Universities: Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais
          (UFMG), Centro Federal de Educação Tecnológica de Minas Gerais
          (CEFET-MG), Universidade Federal do Amazonas (UFAM) e Universidade
          Federal do Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS). The INWEB researchers use a set
          of new techniques related to information recovery, data mining and
          data visualization to understand and summarize what the media and
          users are talking about on the Web. This provides the fundamental
          basis for an evaluation of the impact of the Olympic Campaigns and how
          users react to news and discussions. One new feature in this project
          is the possibility to see the propagation of the Tweets. </p>

        <p>This use case describes a data management facility being constructed
          to support scientific offshore wind energy research for the U.S.
          Department of Energy’s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable
          Energy (EERE) Wind and Water Power Program. The Reference Facility for
          Renewable Energy (RFORE) project is responsible for collecting wind
          characterization data from remote sensing and in-situ instruments
          located on an offshore platform. This raw data is collected by the
          Data Management Facility and processed into a standardized NetCDF
          format. Both the raw measurements and processed data are archived in
          the <abbr title="Pacific Northwest National Laboratory">PNNL</abbr>
          Institutional Computing (PIC) petascale computing facility. The DMF
          will record all processing history, quality assurance work, problem
          reporting, and maintenance activities for both instrumentation and
          data. All datasets, instrumentation, and activities are cataloged
          providing a seamless knowledge representation of the scientific study.
          The DMF catalog relies on linked open vocabularies and domain
          vocabularies to make the study data searchable. Scientists will be
          able to use the catalog for faceted browsing, ad-hoc searches, query
          by example. For accessing individual datasets a REST GET interface to
          the archive will be provided.</p>
        <p> <strong>Challenges:</strong><br />
          For accessing numerous datasets scientists will be accessing the
          archive directly using other protocols such as sftp, rsync, scp, and

      <p>The use cases presented in the previous section illustrate a number of
        challenges faced by data publishers and data consumers. These challenges
        show that some guidance is required on specific areas and therefore best
        practices should be provided. According to the challenges, a set of
        requirements were defined in such a way that a requirement motivates the
        creation of one or more best practices. Challenges related to Data
        Quality and Data Usage motivated the definition of specific requirements
        for the Quality and Granularity Description Vocabulary and the Data
        Usage Vocabulary. </p>
      <section rel="bibo:Chapter" resource="#openclosed" typeof="bibo:Chapter">
        <h3 role="heading" aria-level="2" id="openclosed">A Word on Open and
          Closed Data</h3>
        <p>The Open Knowledge Foundation <a href="http://opendefinition.org/">defines
            open data</a> most succinctly as <em>data that can be freely used,
            modified, and shared by anyone for any purpose</em>. Data on the Web
          may be open but Web technologies are equally applicable to data that
          is not open, or to scenarios where open and closed data are combined.
          There are a number of areas where data may be on the Web but not open.</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Behind The Firewall</strong>
            <p>Closed data may be generated in an organization that then blocks
              general access using a firewall or other access control system.
              Generated data may have links to other "open" data hosted
              elsewhere and it may be represented using open Web standards but
              this cannot be considered "open data."</p>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Proprietary data by policy</strong>
            <p>Data can be closed through the policies of the data publisher and
              data provider. Business-sensitive data that is not made accessible
              to rest of the world is an example of closed data. Data controlled
              by law or government policies are further examples of closed data
              e.g. national security data, law enforcement, health care etc.</p>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Lifecycle state of data</strong>
            <p>There is often a period between the generation of data and its
              publication as open data and data in this state should be
              considered as "closed." The data may remain in a closed state for
              an indefinite period of time while it is validated and analyzed,
              and insights and discoveries are published. It may also remain
              closed because the data publisher prefers to maximize their
              advantage gained by availability of data before they publish it
              openly. This is current common practice in scientific research.</p>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Non HTTP protocol based data</strong>
            <p>Historically data has been exposed using various non-HTTP IETF
              protocol based end points including, but not limited to FTP, SFTP,
              SCP, Rsync. While these protocols are considered "open," their
              inter-operability with HTTP based Web protocol is currently a
              limiting factor. From an open data perspective, data only
              available using these these non-HTTP protocols should be
              considered as closed data and, by definition, is not on the Web.
              It follows that data accessible by private or
              application-specific proprietary access protocol end points are
              also deemed as both closed data and out of scope for data on the
              Web.</p>
